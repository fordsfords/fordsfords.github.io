<p>This story is written by, for, and about computer geeks (or
geek-wannabes).  It represents a fairly near-term future, perhaps
20 years from now.  Maybe less.  Although techno-geeks are my primary
audience, I hope I've written a story that can appeal to the general
science fiction reader.

<p>To that end, I figured I had better explain a few terms:
<ul>
<li>Ping - in addition to being the name of a cat, a "ping" is a computer
network message sent by one computer for the sole purpose of getting a
response from another.  (The term comes from SONAR technology.)
<br><br>

<li>Echo - in addition to being the name of another cat, an "echo" is
a computer network message sent in response to a "ping".  For example,
if I want to know if your computer is working, I will have my computer
send yours a ping.  Your computer will respond with an echo.
<br><br>

<li>NAP - Network Access Point - a computer that is the interface between
the Internet and a human.  Today it would be a PC, but in tomorrow's
world, it won't be thought of as a separate computer that is <em>connected</em>
to the Internet.  It will be <em>part</em> of the Internet.  (FYI - this is
<em>not</em> the normal definition for "NAP".  I made up this usage.)
<br><br>

<li>Bot - any autonomous program that roams the Internet performing some function
for it's owner.  For example, a "dig-bot" digs for information.  A "trace-bot"
attempts to trace a network connection to it's source.
<br><br>

<li>Autonomous User Agent - a bot that listens to Internet traffic more passively
than a dig-bot, and usually is interested in a wider range of topics.
</ul>

<p>There are probably more terms that I should define that I can't think
of off hand.  Let me know if there are things I should clarify.
