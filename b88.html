<p><i>It's time for the Continuing Adventures of Borris, the Amazing Talking Dog!
<br>
<br>Brought to you this week by Chuck Wagon Dog Food.

<p><i>The story so far: Borris has infiltrated an ex-KGB-turned-narco-trafficing ring.
<br>But his cover may be blown by the beautiful but deadly Svetlana Svetzaloff,
<br>leader of the ring, who has challenged Borris to a game of deadly chess.</i>

<p><i>We join Borris now for episode 88: The Deadly Game.</i>

<b>
<p>Svetlana and her henchmen smile coldly at Borris over the chess board.
<br>She purrs, "Zo, mine darlink leettle von, if you are who you zay you are,
<br>zen you are knowink ze next move."

<p>Borris glances nonchalantly at the game,
<br>then fixes his gaze on his beautiful but deadly tormentor.
<br>"Is it dinner time?"

<p>The color drains from Svetlana's face.
<br>Eyes wide, lips trembling, she breaths,
<br>"You vin zees round, clever von,
<br>but zere vill come a reckonink."
</b>

<p><i>Will Borris be able to resist Svetlana's deadly charms?
<br>Will Svetlana's web of deceit unravel the congressional hearing?
<br>Will Borris get big moist meaty chunks, or dry kibble?
