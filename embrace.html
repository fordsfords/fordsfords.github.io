The Deadly Embrace
</h1>

<hr>

<p>I can run, but I can't hide! In fact, I CAN'T EVEN RUN!!!

<p>I struggle to free myself from the the deadly embrace of the two
semaphores. The daemons surrounding me lick their lips hungrily,
looking me up and down, trying to decide where in to sink their
10-inch fangs. At a signal from The Colonel, all nine of them will
descend upon me and kill me instantly, abruptly. I smile ruefully;
they won't even give me a chance to clean up first.

<p>I look at the semaphores. They are standing on either side of me,
each in a stiff blue uniform. They tower above me, completely ignoring
me and the daemons. They only look at each other and repeat endlessly,
"Oh no!  After YOU." I had already tried cutting my way out with my
trusty Swiss Army knife, but they seemed to be made out of steel.

<p>"Oh no!  After YOU."

<p>I close my eyes tightly and put my hands over my ears. THINK, damn it!
There HAS to be a way out of this mess. If only I hadn't been so
afraid of the daemons that I asked <em>both</em> of the semaphores for
protection. Now, my very protectors will be my death.  If only I could
start over, I would go it alone without any protection!  If only ...

<p>Wait a minute ... 

<p>I reach into my pocket and pull out the Swiss Army knife. Lets see.
Knife? No. Spoon? No. Ah, here we are.

<p>And just as The Colonel gives the signal and the daemons start rushing
in, I flip out the fork ...

<p>... and start over. The daemons are busily devouring me; the
<em>old</em> me. The <em>new</em> me smiles and starts running.
