Short Fiction

<hr>

<p>There are times, late at night, that I can <em>almost</em> make myself
believe that I could be a professional writer if I really worked at
it.  I've even submitted a story to a magazine in an attempt to prove
it to myself.  (It was rejected, of course.)

<p>Anyway, I don't write very much any more.  Most of my writing took
place during the last couple of years working at Siemens.  What got me
to thinking about it again is an article in the paper the other day
which said, "If you want to write, get a job you hate.  You'll write."
I guess my experience certainly supports that assertion.
