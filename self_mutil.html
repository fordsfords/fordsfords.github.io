Self Mutilation in Nebraska
</h1>

<hr>

<p>This isn't so much a story as it is a set of vignettes drawn from my
family's recent vacation.  For two and a half weeks, we travelled by
car and
<a href="wimp-camping.html">wimp camped</a>
in the Black Hills in South Dakota (home of Mt. Rushmore, the "bad
lands", Wall Drug, and Reptile Gardens), Yellowstone NP (mostly in
North West Wyoming), and Rocky Mountains NP (in Colorado, right beside
the town of Estes Park).

<p>I suppose I could write at length about all the cool stuff we saw at
our stops along the way.  But for some reason, the boring drives in
between seem to invoke my muse more forcefully.  Who am I to argue?

<h2><a name=Lbl1>
Wall Drug</a></h2>

<p>We're driving through Wisconsin on our way to South Dakota.  As we pass
<a href="dells.html">Wisconsin Dells</a>
the Tommy Bartlet bill boards suddenly give way to Wall Drug bill boards.
Wall Drug <em>this,</em> 500 miles.  Wall Drug <em>that,</em> 470 miles.  Wall Drug
has Free Ice Water, Wall Drug has an 80 foot dinosaur, Wall Drug - a
great place to poop.  There are even
Wall Drug signs that advertise <em>other</em> Wall Drug signs ("There's a
Wall Drug sign in Egypt!").  It gets quite tiresome.

<p>Once we cross the South Dakota border, the bill boards show up in
earnest.  Most of them are for Wall Drug, but we also see a lot of
signs for
<a href="gutzon.html">Gutzon Borglum</a>
("He Carved the Rock"), and
... could it be? ... REPTILE GARDENS!  All Right, Karen and I are
excited!  Is it close to our campground?  Do we have time to go
there?  Can we get a bumper sticker?  (I <em>really</em> want one for my Sun
SPARCstation.)

<p>The kids have no idea what we're talking about.  &lt;sigh&gt;  Modern Youth
have no appreciation for High Culture.

<p>By the time we reach the
<a href="badlands.html">badlands</a>,
we're so sick of Wall Drug signs that we could puke.  Finally, we see
the turnoff for Wall Drug.  We cheer as I pass it without slowing down.
The siege is over!  Free at last!  Then inspiration strikes.  Now I
know what I <em>really</em> want ... a bumper sticker that says:

<blockquote>
I drove past Wall Drug <em>WITHOUT STOPPING</em>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name=Lbl2>
HCF</a></h2>

<p>We leave South Dakota in search of Yellowstone.  This is a loooooooong
drive.  And although there is a certain stark beauty in the endless
Wyoming scrub, it can only hold you attention so long.

<p>It was during a similar long drive many years ago that Karen and I
invented a new license plate game.  It works best with the 3-letter,
4-number plates; the object is to come up with the "best" assembly
language instruction to go with the 3-letter part.  For example, "HCF"
would be "Halt and Catch Fire".  "ICA" might be "Increment and Clear
Accumulator".  You get the idea.

<p>Alas, the kids have very little patience for this kind of geek
entertainment.  So we occupy much of our time picking at each other
until we finally settle on the "ABC Disease Game".  I start by saying:

<ul>
<li>I'm going to the hospital, and I've got Anthrax.
</ul>

<p>Karen says:

<ul>
<li>I'm going to the hospital, and I've got Anthrax and Bulimia.
</ul>

<p>Becky chimes in with:

<ul>
<li>I'm going to the hospital, and I've got Anthrax, Bulimia, and Cataracts.
</ul>

<p>And so on.

<p>A little later, Becky has to pee.  So we tell her to try not to think
about water falls, gushers, or leaky faucets.  Then we sing "Raindrops
Keep Falling on my Head", "Old Man River", and "Michael Row your Boat
Ashore".  (This is pay-back time for all the "are we there yet" whines.)

<p>It's a looooong day.

<h2><a name=Lbl3>
Big Tits</a></h2>

<p>We leave Yellowstone, bidding a fond farewell to hydrogen sulfide and
enter the Grand Tetons.  "Lookit them big tits!" yells Karen, always
quick to offer helpful French translations.  (We also had some fun
with the Nez Pierce river.)

<p>What can one say about the Tetons, besides "Great View"?

<p>Round about lunch time, we enter the outskirts of Dubois (French for
"of the wood"), population 837.  Great.  Our food prospects promise
to be a slice of E-Z-Cheez pizza at a Git-n-Go.  I pull over at a
Super 8 Motel and ask the clerk where we could grab a bite of lunch.

<blockquote>
"The Cowboy Cafe - halfway into town on the right."
</blockquote>

<p>Oh boy.

<p>We enter town and discover it's not the tiny ink-spot we thought it
would be.  Evidently, cowboy kitsch is big business.  Western "art",
western furniture, western apparel, and western food.  The Cowboy Cafe
has a <em>matrix</em> of burgers; the vertical axis is typical: "burger",
"burger with cheese", "double burger", "double burger with cheese",
etc.  The horizontal axis is new to me: "hamburger", "steer",
"buffalo", and "garden".  The waitress explains that steer is leaner
than hamburger, and buffalo is leaner still.  I stick with hamburger.

<p>After eating, I make a pit stop.  Upon entering the bathroom, I am
immediately struck by a contraption on the wall.  A round hole in the
wall, obviously once containing a ventilation fan, is now covered with
what looks like a white plastic lid to a large round container
(Tub-o-lard?).  A smaller hole is cut in the plastic lid, to which a
short length of dryer vent hose is attached.  This leads to a
ventilation fan ... a <em>square</em> ventilation fan, which is mounted to
the wall with a coat hanger.  Duct tape holds everything together.

<p>Hmmm...

<p>I go to pay, and I see another unusual artifact - on top of the cash
register is a Far Side calendar.

<p>That clinches it - this place MUST be run by an engineer!  My mind reels
at the implications.  Are we witness to a proto-engineer who just
didn't quite make critical mass?  Or an old burned-out engineer who
started a new life in a foreign land?  And an even bigger question -
how could an engineer possibly survive without at least a 56K Internet
connection?  (Does Wyoming even <em>have</em> an ISP?)

<p>As we drive out of Dubois, we pass a coffee shop named "Pony
Expresso".  We're a loooooong way from home.

Self Mutilation in Nebraska</a></h2>

<p>Our vacation is now over.  We leave Colorado and get on I-80 for the
long trip back home.  Shortly after crossing the Nebraska border, we
stop at a rest area for an early lunch.  There is a visitor center
with little pamphlets describing the many tourist attractions in
Nebraska.  Here are just a few:

<ul>
<li>Pioneer Village - with over 50,000 historical items, including
40 old snow mobiles, all different.

<li>Oregon Trail Wagon Train - go on a trip in a covered wagon for up
to six days.

<li>Museum of the Fur Trade

<li>Carhenge - the only replica of Stonehenge in the world
constructed entirely of old cars.

<li>Haybale Church - only church in the world built from baled hay.

<li>Worlds Largest Porch Swing

<li>Worlds Smallest Courthouse

<li>Ole's Big Game Lounge - worlds largest collection of
privately owned mounted hunting trophies.

<li>National Museum of Roller Skating in Lincoln - the only one of it's kind in
the world (as if you didn't already guess that).
</ul>

<p>Also in that visitor center is a post card
that gives a few "fun facts" about Nebraska.  At the end, it says "The
long drive across Nebraska is what ever you make of it."  Uh-oh.

<p>Dave Barry once asked why we need <em>two</em> Dakotas.  He must never have
driven across Nebraska.  Karen and I have been married for over 15
years.  After that long, there just aren't all that many things left
that we haven't talk about.  And those were covered over the past two
weeks.  I guess it's time to start over.  "Hi, I'm Steve.  What's your
major?"

<p>But it doesn't take long for our eyes to glaze over and our heads to empty
of all rational thought.  Primitive urges take over; we are reduced
to snarling beasts.  At least most of us are ... David is strangely
silent.  Normally this would be a clear signal that Something Is
Wrong, but driving through Nebraska is not normal.

<blockquote>
"Hey Dad, lookit this!"
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"I can't.  I'm driving."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Just for a second."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<em>"I can't.  I'm driving."</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Just look."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"One ... two ... three ... four ..."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Just for a second."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<em>"Twenty seven ... twenty eight ... twenty nine ..."</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Then Karen starts to snort violently.  At first I think she's choking.
Good - one less person to have to go pee.  But no, she's trying to
talk and laugh at the same time.  After repeated attempts, the ugly
truth finally comes out.  David has been scratching "tattoos" into his
arms and legs with a nail clipper.

<p><em>My</em> nail clipper.

<blockquote>
"Don't worry, Dad, they lick right off!"
</blockquote>

<p>Only three zillion more miles to go.
