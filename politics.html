Politics as Usual

<hr>

<p>I was very sick a few years ago. Foul substances being violently
thrown from orifices I didn't even know I had.  During my semi-awake
periods, the following story unfolded.  Even though it probably belongs
<em>nowhere</em> but the semi-awake periods of a semi-alive sicko, I
present it here.  If you're not a <a href="/">chinet</a>
user, then some boring <a href="politics1.html">background information</a>
might help you understand it.  Then again, maybe it won't.

<p>The tension in the Chicago city counsel chamber was so thick you
could smell it. Alderman sdrone and sgt.-at-arms jcs were arguing
the relative merits of RNA-impregnated bullets v.s. Coldain
exploding bullets. (Coldain took microseconds to kill as opposed to
RNA's 200 milliseconds, but also made a considerable mess.) Alderman
saj was jacked into the latest release of doom and blood could be
seen trickling down his face from behind the VR goggles. And
alderotter duffy was circling mayor hobbit menacingly, snarling and
spitting, looking for an opening. But hobbit had his Hammer-O-Thor
gavel raised and he chuckled deeply and richly (thanks to his
Thunder-O-Thor voice implants).

<p>Alderman jonnie pleaded with them to grow up and get back to the
subject of their special session, but Alderman randy yanked off a
titanium armrest from his wheelchair and cracked jonnie across the
mouth. "Come ON," shouted randy, "I wanna see some BLOOD! I've
almost got it hard for the first time this week!"

<p>Suddenly, duffy reached into his pants, pulled out his diaphragm,
and hurled it at hobbit. The mayor recoiled in horror as the 9-inch
disk passed within an inch of his throat. It whizzed by and sunk
it's razor-sharp edge into the wall. Duffy leaped forward, bit
hobbit's knee, and then scampered behind randy's wheelchair.
Hobbit's thunderbolt was absorbed harmlessly by randy's force field.
Randy's face broke into a blissful grin.

<p>Hendrix dashed through the chamber door for the third time that day.
Jcs planted a bullet in her forehead and her body dropped lifelessly
on her other two bodies. "Hey," complained sdrone, "it was MY turn!"

<p>                                * * *

<p>Meanwhile, in a high polar orbit around the earth, a weapons
platform waited silently and patiently for instructions. Whose
platform it was depended on whose virus had most recently invaded
the master control. Nobody knew for sure any more.

<p>The space to the right of a high-energy particle accelerator
shimmered briefly and then turned inside-out. Through the gaping maw
of the wormhole a 55 gallon drum drifted. It settled down next to
the accelerator and space turned right-side-in again. After a
moment, the lid of the drum popped off with a shower of ice
crystals. Then, two thin gray tentacles snaked out of from the top
of the drum and gracefully drifted to the accelerator's slave
control panel.

<p>                                * * *

<p>Back in the counsel chambers, chaos was increasing. duffy had found
a length of garden hose and was trying to interface it to the gargle
blaster containment vessel. Hobbit had to amputate another three
inches off his leg to halt the infection. Jcs and sdrone were
standing by the open window, spraying gunfire into the building
across the street.

<p>Suddenly, the chamber door opened again and in stepped the very
object of this special session of the counsel, a Timb. "I come with
a proposal" it announced.

<p>Jcs calmly raised his pistol and fired The bullet slammed into the
floor an inch to the right of the Timb. A few scattered chuckles
danced through the chamber as jcs monkeys with the sight.

<p>"Hear me out! It's our only chance!" shouts the Timb. A second
bullet splintered the wood floor a quarter inch to the Timb's left.
The chamber erupted in hoots and catcalls. "Fucking Canadian
imports!" screamed jcs as he hurls the pistol out the window and
raises his BFG. The Timb's last words could not be heard above the
roar and explosion and then a six-foot crater marked the spot where
the Timb used to be.

<p>The space in the center of the chamber shimmered and then turned
inside out. Through the gaping maw of the worm hole dropped a 55
gallon drum and a high-energy particle accelerator, tethered
together by long gray tentacles. The air in the counsel chamber
roared thorough the worm hole, carrying saj, sdrone, and hobbit with
it before the space turned right-side-in again.

<p>But, even before the wormhole had closed, the particle accelerator
spat a blinding lance of light, which seared through the air and
connected with randy's force field. The wheelchair immediately began
to glow a ruddy red as it struggled to absorb the energy.

<p>Duffy plunged his hand into his pants, hoping to sever the tentacles
with his diaphragm. But, as the diaphragm was now stuck in the wall,
his hand closed on his own self. A look of serenity passed over his
face and he sat down dreamily.

<p>Randy was whooping and bucking like a cowboy as the glow from the
wheelchair brightened and bathed the chamber in ultraviolet light.

<p>Then the field failed.

<p>The expanding shockwave of energy collapsed the atoms in it's path
and made a trillion microscopic neutron stars, which raced outward
and momentarily made Chicago a beacon for the nation.

<p>The next day, President billv signed a peace treaty with the Timb
nation, granting them exclusive rights to California. The nation
breathed a sigh of relief and changed the channel.
