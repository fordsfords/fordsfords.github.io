Hide and Seek
</h1>

<hr>

<p>"This will be the last game of the evening.  Then everybody has to call
it quits.  OK?"

<p>Mom was standing on the front porch, looking down at the five of us:
Ted and Jerry Porter, Lee Wilson, my brother Stan, and me, Kim Ward.
I was the oldest by several years.  I had just graduated from high
school, so I could stay out longer if I wanted to.  But what would be
the fun of that if I were alone?

<p>"I said, OK?"  Mom tapped her shoe.

<p>"OK" we all grumbled.  When she demands an answer to "OK", it means that
she won't give in later.  Mom smiled and went back inside.  One last
game of hide and seek.  Lee was "it" and he started counting to 100.
The rest of us ran in all directions.

<p>It was a heavy August evening - humid and close.  The temperature was in the
upper 80s.  A full moon tried to burn its way through a hazy sky.  Each
street light wore a cloud if insects; the porch lights had smaller
swarms.  The trees emitted a steady drone of cicada song, their monotony
occasionally broken by a barking dog.

<p>The evening had flown by too fast, as usual.  The summer was quickly slipping
away.  High school was over in a blink.  My parents had
readily agreed to support me for one last summer, but in the fall when
my friends started school again I would be expected to become
responsible.  Get a job.  Get a life.

<p>The future stood before me as a tree of possibilities.  Choices to be
made.  College or job?  (That's a joke!  Even my parents didn't think
I was smart enough for college.)  Which job to take?  Who to marry?
Where to live?  Each branch in the tree of possibilities demanded a
choice.  And each choice eliminated whole sections of the tree.
Closed doors.  Opportunities lost.  I didn't want to grow up yet!  I
still felt like the little tomboy I had always been; how could I
start making important choices now?

<p>I guess the thing that scared me most was getting a full-time job.  I
had seen my parents come home every night half-dead, too tired to
enjoy life.  Did grownups ever have fun?  Oh sure, I've seen parties
where they try to.  Like the new year's eve party my parents gave at
our house.  The evening consisted of drinking too much, laughing too
loudly, and talking, talking, talking.  Mostly bitching, really.
Bitching about their jobs and houses and kids, bitching about their
lives in general.  The closest thing to fun that I saw (while spying
through the clothes chute) was my dad's boss getting a little too
friendly with my mom.  She giggled like a school girl (what a stupid
phrase; <em>I</em> certainly don't giggle) and kept telling him to "stop it"
in a way that certainly didn't sound like "stop it".  Some fun.  My
mom and dad fought over that for two whole months.

<p>So there I stood, on the threshold to a living death, trying to hold
onto my freedom for one more summer.  One more evening.  One more game
of hide and seek.

<p>I ran North, past two houses, and then I ducked behind the third.
There was a small wooden tool shed back there, a dilapidated old thing
with peeling paint, a door that wouldn't close all the way, and piles
of junk inside.  I reached the shed and slowed down.  Although it
was 10:30 at night, the moon and street lights made it pretty well lit outside.
But the interior of the shed was an ominous black hole that seemed to
suck up all the light in front of it.  I was about to change my mind
and hide somewhere else when I heard, "Ready or not, here I come!"
Lee must have counted by fives, the rat.  No time to change, I darted
into the shed.

<p>Right into a spider web.  It hit me square in the face!  Ugh, I've
never liked spiders.  I closed my eyes and clawed at my face,
forgetting to stop before I blundered into the back wall. Paint cans
clattered around me as I twisted to the right and fell face-first into
a pile of moldy drop cloths.

<p>I tried to scream, but between the damp August heat and the powerful
mildew smell, I felt like I was suffocating.  I thought I could feel
spiders all over me.  I blindly fought my way forward on my hands and
knees and smacked my head against the right wall.  I rolled to my
right and tried to stand up.  But there was a low shelf above my head
and I hit it hard.  (I never knew it before, but you really <em>do</em> see
stars when you hit your head too hard.)  I pitched forward and crashed
into to the front wall.  Then I felt my way to the door and rolled out
into the night.

<p>AHH!  Fresh air!  After being in that shed, it felt like a cool May
night instead of a muggy August one.  I wiped my face off and the
spidery feeling slowly dissipated.  I was sort of dizzy and my
battered head was pretty sore, so I lay on my back, gasping for
breath, and waiting for the sky to stop spinning.  After all the noise
I made, I figured I would be caught by Lee in a second.  So, I just
waited there, looking at the sky.  The moon was a beautiful crescent,
casting a faint light on the dim landscape around me.  Except for a
single cricket chirping nearby, there was perfect silence.

<p>A shiver ran through me and I pulled my arms inside my T-shirt to keep
warm.  Something seemed different, but I couldn't quite place it.
The silence seemed too complete.  Shouldn't I be hearing the other
kids?  Or something?

<p>The cicadas!  That's why it seemed too quiet, the cicadas weren't calling
from the trees anymore.  Do they quit at a certain hour of the night?  I
didn't think so.

<p>I looked around, but it was too dark to see.  The houses were just
looming black shapes, devoid of detail.  It seemed darker than it did
before.  I lay back again, puzzling over the strangeness of the
night, staring at the moon.  That beautiful thin crescent moon.

<p>That's when the bottom dropped out of my stomach.  The moon was
supposed to be <em>full!</em>  I looked wildly around again.  No street
lights.  No lights of any kind.  No cars driving by, no kids running
around, no dogs barking, no cicadas calling.  And cold!  Instead of
the upper 80s, it had to be 60 degrees.  In spite of the cold, my body
was instantly covered with fear sweat.

<p>Confused and disoriented, I leaped to my feet and ran back to my
house.  Or what used to be my house.  I stopped in front of a low
mound of ruins and looked in horror at charred timbers sticking up out
of rubble.  There was no smoke or smell; it must have burned a long
time before.

<p>I pushed my panic down and told myself that none of this was real; it
couldn't be real.

<p>The tool shed!  The world had changed while I was in there.  Perhaps
one of the bops on my head had knocked me out, and all this was just a
dream.  For some reason, I felt convinced that by returning to the
shed, I could rejoin my sleeping body and wake up.

<p>I ran back, past the two houses, turned the corner, and smashed
directly into a tall, lanky man.  We collapsed in a heap and I
screamed.

<p>"SHHH!" he hissed, clamping his hand across my mouth.  I struggled for a
moment and then stopped.  The man appeared to be listening intently for
a moment, and then he whispered, "I'm sure we were heard.  Come this way
quick.  And shut up for God's sake!"

<p>He pulled me up by the hand and led the way behind three more houses to
the end of the block.  There should have been an empty field farther
on, but instead a dark forest loomed.  The man let go of my hand and eased
himself into a drainage ditch choked with weeds.  Confused and afraid,
I followed, both of us on our hands and knees, crawling toward the street.

<p>At the street's dead end, erosion had eaten away some of the soil from
under the concrete, making a shallow cave.  The man rolled into the cave,
disappearing into the dark.  I crouched there, trying to decide
whether I should follow him or run back to the shed.  Before I could
decide, I heard a heavy clomping and a metallic jingle not far away
and coming closer.

<p>My mind screamed "HIDE", so I stretched out and rolled into the cave
with the man.  I held my breath as the clomping slowed down and stopped
right above us.  A flashlight beam leaped into the forest and darted
back and forth, up and down.  Then the light reached into the ditch,
feeling its way through the weeds.  It passed by us and continued up
the ditch.

<p>"Where the Hell did they go?  They can't be far" a deep voice rasped
quietly.  A higher voice said, "How many do you figure?"

<p>"Two, maybe three.  The scream came from a girl, for sure."

<p>"You think they're in the woods?"

<p>"Don't think so.  They were running fast enough that we would have
heard them in the underbrush.  They've gotta be in one of the houses."

<p>"I'll stand guard near the street while you check them out."

<p>The clomping resumed, this time getting farther away.  A moment later,
a tinkle of broken glass could be heard.  Then nothing.  I slowly let
my breath out and turned to the man behind me.  "What's going on?" I
whispered.  But he shushed me again, so I just lay there, up against a
man I still hadn't seen clearly, shivering both from fright and from
cold.

<p>The night wore on.  The only thing that marked the passage of time was
another cricket chirping.  In spite of my fear, I dosed off for I don't
know how long.

<p>I awoke with a start when a hand grasped my shoulder.  Not knowing
where I was, I tried to sit up, and succeeded in cracking my head on
the concrete above me.

<p>"Hey, take it easy!  Jeez!"  The voice, and the hand, came from
behind me.  "You OK?"

<p>"OW!  Uh, oh my head...  I think I'll be all right."  I rolled out of
the shallow cave and climbed up to the street.  The man
followed me.  Only he wasn't a man.  He couldn't have been more than
14 years old.  He was dressed all in black - jeans, sweatshirt,
sneakers, and stocking cap.  I guessed his socks, if any, were
probably black too.  We were both dirty from rolling around in the
dirt, but his face and hands had grime that was weeks old, not just
from that night.

<p>He was looking me over just as curiously as I was looking at him.  I'm
5 foot, 7 inches tall and I had shoulder length dark-blond hair
(sounds better than light brown).  I wore a red Micky Mouse
T-shirt, dark blue jeans, pale blue sneakers, and no socks.

<p>I turned and looked down the street that I called home.  The street
itself was cracked and full of pot holes.  Weeds grew through the
cracks, and the curbs were just rubble.  There were no cars.  The
houses were also messes.  About every fifth or sixth one was burned to
the ground.  The rest had most of their windows broken and doors
missing.  Off in the distance, where there should have been a large
shopping mall, was an enormous building with smoke stacks belching
thick black plumes.

<p>I was cold and confused and my mind was too numb to try to make sense
out of what was going on.  My brain was running on auto-pilot.  So, I turned
back to the boy and smiled weakly.  "Hi.  I'm Kim.  I'm kinda new
here."

<p>"No kidding.  I'm Fred.  You hungry?"

<p>I did feel a dull ache in my stomach, but a more urgent need had to be
dealt with first.  "Yeah, but first I've got to go to the bathroom."

<p>Fred looked quizzically at me.  "What do you mean?  Where's that?"

<p>I was hoping <em>he</em> would tell me.  "I don't know.  But if I don't find
one soon, I'm going to pee in my pants."

<p>Fred shrugged his shoulders and turned back toward the drainage ditch.
I was thinking I would try one of the houses when I heard a splashing
noise beside me.  I looked and saw Fred peeing in a long arch, right
where we had been hiding.

<p>The chill left my body and I could feel my face turning red.  Fred
finished, turned, and started walking down the street.  "Well, pee if
you have to.  I'm getting some breakfast."  I had no idea where I
could find food on my own, so I quickly scrambled into the ditch (a
little way upstream), relieved myself, and then ran to catch up with
Fred.

<p>My mind started to wake up.  A hundred questions multiplied into a
thousand as we walked along the familiar streets.  We turned a few
corners and walked toward my old elementary school.  There were quite
a few other kids, boys and girls, ranging in age from a little younger
than Fred to a little older than me.  They were all dressed identical
to Fred, and all were on their way to the school.

<p>Time to start on my questions.  I turned to Fred and asked, "What year
is this?"

<p>Fred looked at me funny and said, "I'm 15, if that's what you mean."

<p>"No, I mean what's today's date?"

<p>Fred just shook his head.  "You sure do ask a lot of stupid
questions."  What a jerk!  If he didn't know, he could have just said
so.  I decided my questions could wait.

<p>We entered the school and walked down the hall toward the lunch room.
The classrooms on either side were full of people lying on the floor, sleeping.
They all wore black too, but they were older, twenties and thirties.
They each had a long flashlight.

<p>"Who are they?" I asked, forgetting my resolve to shut up.

<p>"Second shift."

<p>We reached the lunch room and stood in a short line.  The room didn't have
the usual rows of tables; it was devoid of all furniture.  There were
about 150 kids, all dressed alike.  Each kid had a tin cup and most of
them were eating thin beige strips that looked a little like beef
jerky.  The room buzzed with quiet conversation.

<p>When Fred and I reached the front of the line, we were
each given our "breakfast".  The tin cup contained a thin brownish
broth that had a few limp vegetables floating in it.  There were six
beige strips.  None of it had any taste to speak of.

<p>We joined three other kids, two boys and a girl,
and Fred introduced me.  Sort of.  He jerked
his thumb at me and said "Kim.  She don't know much."

<p>The older boy said "I'm Kerry."  The girl said "Teresa."  The younger
boy said "Rich."  Quite the talkative bunch.

<p>Kerry said to Fred, "Where were you last night?"

<p>"I was on my way when she ran right into me and yelled.  We had to
hide quick in the ditch."

<p>Kerry turned to me and said, "Where do you usually hide?"

<p>I turned a little red; Fred was right, I didn't know much.  "I just
arrived in the area.  Last night was my first night here.  I'm afraid
I don't know what's going on.  Who are you hiding from?"

<p>Rich nodded toward the hall.  "Second shift."

<p>Teresa said, "Hey, you could hide with us!"  Fred gave her a dirty
look, but she went on, "I'm tired of being the only girl.  There's
enough room.  You got a work card?" she asked me.

<p>I spread my hands.  "No."

<p>Kerry said, "I'll see if I can get one for you with a few years
on it.  The second shifter who relieves me usually has one or two."
He looked me over.  "You'll need some different clothes, though.
Under the moon you'll stand out like anything.  Here."

<p>He took off his sweatshirt and gave it to me.  Teresa said, "Yeah, lets
all pitch in" and she took off her shoes and socks.

<p>There was a pause, during which Fred and Rich looked sullen.  Then
Kerry reached out and snatched Fred's hat.  "Hey!"  Fred lunged toward
the hat but Kerry held it over his head.

<p>"Take it easy, Freddie, it'll only cost you an hour or two."  Kerry
put the hat on top of my pile.

<p>Rich suddenly gripped his pants and said, "She's not getting these!"
The rest of us laughed and Kerry said, "Her jeans are just fine."
Suddenly, a loud bell rang and the room let out a collective groan.
Kerry said to me, "First shift is about to start.  Meet us here at the
end of first shift and we'll eat together."  He turned and everybody
started shuffling out a set of double doors, tossing their cups into a
barrel.

<p>I touched Kerry's arm.  "Should I just wait here?"

<p>"No.  Walk around the district and get the lay of the land.  When the
afternoon whistle blows, make your way back here.  We'll eat and get
some rest.  Then at midnight, when second shift lets out, you'll hide with
us."  Together we walked out of the school.

<p>Once outside, Kerry and the others were lost in the mob that was
surging toward the factory.  I pulled the sweatshirt over my shirt and
put on the socks, shoes, and hat.  My old shoes were in pretty bad
shape, so I just pitched them in some bushes.  Then, giving the first
shift one last look as they filed into the factory, I started walking
back to my neighborhood.

<p>The whole area was deserted.  I got a real creepy feeling walking back
to my street.  It seemed like the ruined houses were looking
reproachfully at me, blaming me for their misfortune.  A shrill
whistle screamed from the factory; first shift must be starting.  Did
that mean that a third shift was just letting out?  My stomach
tightened and I quickened my pace.

<p>I returned to my street.  I paused before the ruin of my former home,
considering if I should paw through the rubble.  But it had obviously
been picked clean of anything but trash, so I continued on.  Past two
houses, and behind the third.  To the shed.

<p>In the daylight I was surprised to see that it was empty.  Where was all
the junk I had tripped over the night before?  I thought about going
in there to see if it would magically transport me back to my own time,
but I was too curious about my new surroundings.  Last night, the
danger seemed overwhelming.  Now that danger had turned to excitement.

<p>And I kind of liked Kerry.  When he took off his sweatshirt, I could
see that there wasn't an ounce of fat on him.  But he wasn't muscle
bound either.  Thin and wiry, and only a wisp of hair on his chest.
Even though I had just graduated from high school, I hadn't really had
any serious boy friends yet.  They all seemed too plain and mundane.
They seemed to be sliding into boring adulthood before they even got
their diplomas.

<p>But for some reason, I thought Kerry was above all that.  Even though
I had only been with him for 15 minutes, I thought I had him figured
out.  He was smart, but in a street sense.  He was a dreamer, but was
always aware of what was going on around him.  He was a thief, a
rouge; he could slip in and out of your presence without being
noticed.  With these big thoughts filling my mind, I turned and left
my familiar street, to get a feel for the new landscape.

<p>As I explored, I found an entire block that was completely destroyed by
some kind of explosion.  There was a crater fifty feet across, partly
filled in with garbage.  I stepped forward to get a closer look.  Although
some of the trash looked fairly fresh, there was almost no odor.  I saw
quite a few black shapes mingled in with the refuse.  I suddenly realized
that they were crows.  Dead crows.  A shudder ran through my body and I
jogged away.  For the rest of the day, I kept an eye open for any
animal life, but I didn't see anything except the occasional insect.

<p>I found a group of stores near the factory.  In my own time, when the
factory was a large enclosed mall, we called these nearby strip malls
"shopping suburbs".  As I walked by, I saw the small parking lot
covered with broken glass.  The shops were ransacked.  Even the shop
signs were ripped off the front, leaving pale outlines of the letters
on the bricks.

<p>I was making my way back to my street, hoping to check out the woods,
when the factory again screamed the shift change.  The day had gone
by quickly, and I realized that I was pretty hungry.

<p>When I arrived at the school lunchroom, my heart sank when I saw that
the afternoon fare was the same as breakfast - beige strips and thin
soup.  Kerry and the others were already there.  When I joined them,
Fred made a face and turned to Kerry.  "I tell you, we're making a
mistake.  She don't know nuthin.  She'll get us all found!"

<p>"She'll do just fine," said Kerry, "we've got good hiding places and a
good track record.  Besides, the work card I got for her is for our
own district so she's here to stay whether we like it or not.  If we
show her the ropes, we'll all be safer than if she is just running
around blindly."

<p>Fred scowled, "Humph.  We'll see.  I'll hide someplace else tonight,
just in case.  Anybody going with me?"  He glared at Rich and Teresa,
who stared uncomfortably at their shoes.  "Fine.  So much the better
for me.  See you tomorrow, if you're still around."  He downed the
rest of his soup and stomped off into the school hallways.

<p>Teresa turned to me and said, "Don't pay any attention to him.  He's
still mad about the silly hat and the couple of hours it cost him.
When he sees you tomorrow, he'll treat you like one of us ... which
isn't much better, believe me."  We both grinned.

<p>"Before I forget," said Kerry, reaching into his pocket, "this has
about 6000 hours on it.  Not much, but it's a start."  He handed
me a plastic card.  It had no printing or markings on it.  It
just had the usual black strip along one edge.

<p>I stared at it and said, "Thanks.  I guess.  I still don't get it.
What's all this stuff about hours?"

<p>Kerry took out his own card and looked at it.  "You work eight hours a
day for ten years - that's about 30,000 hours.  Then you get promoted
to second shift.  If you get in trouble, like needing replacement
clothes, they dock you so many hours.  Fred's new hat cost him two
hours.  Teresa's shoes cost twenty."

<p>"Oh, Gosh, I'm sorry," I exclaimed, "Can I transfer my hours to you?"

<p>Teresa smiled.  "No you can't.  But don't worry about it.  We help each
other out all the time.  Even Fred bailed me out once when I lost
a shoe for the second time in a week.  That would have cost me 100
hours!  Naturally Fred reminded me of his generosity every day for
months afterward.  But he's really an OK guy."

<p>We finished our meal and Rich led the way out of the lunch room and into
the school hallway.  "Now what?" I asked.

<p>Rich said, "Now we get some sleep before second shift lets out."  He
led us into one of the classrooms where I had seen the second shifters
sleeping earlier that day.  The room was filling up fast, so we staked
out our territory in one corner.  We all exchanged good nights and the
three of them lay down on the floor.  But my mind was racing too
fast for sleep.  So, I crouched in the corner and watched the people
filter in and lay down.

<p>I only understood bits and pieces of this new world.  There didn't
seem to be any money; everything was either free (the food and
lodging, such as it was) or was paid for with work hours.  From the
look of the crowd, it seemed like kids started working first shift
when they were eight or nine.  During the day they worked, then they
slept till midnight, and then hid from second shift.  After ten years
of that, they got promoted.  Then THEY did the seeking.

<p>But what happened after that?  From what I saw of the sleeping second
shifters, they seemed to range in age from twenty to thirty.  What
happens after ten years of second shift?  Another promotion?  To third
shift?  And what happens after 10 years of that?  Retirement in a
Florida condo?  Somehow I didn't think so.

<p>And, of course, the grand prize question: why?  Why all the hiding and
seeking?  I could tell it wasn't all just an innocent game; what
happened if you got caught?  Did you lose work hours?  Were the second
shifters a bunch of thugs who delighted in beating up first shifters?
Did they kill you?

<p>One thing I hoped was that second shift meant better food.  Imagine
surviving on a steady diet of beef jerky and soup.  I pictured a
second shifter, sitting down at a fancy table with candles and fine
china.  A formal waiter brings a serving platter, pulls the top off
with a flourish, and offers a mound of beige strips.  I reach for a
handful, but the waiter says, "Ah, ah, ah!  Use your fork.  that will
be ten hours please."  I hand him my card and he swipes it through a
portable card reader on his belt.

<p>I look down and see 10 different forks of various shapes and sizes.  I
pick one at random and again reach for the strips.  "Ah, ah, ah!  Wrong
fork.  Another ten hours."  Swipe!

<p>I look at the nine remaining forks and sigh resignedly.  "No thanks.
I'm not hungry."

<p>"Ah, ah, ah!  You need to grow big and strong."  Swipe!

<p>"Could you give me just a hint?" I plead.

<p>"Ah, ah, ah!"  Swipe!  Swipe!  Swipe!

<p>I rise from my seat and reach out to grab the card back, but a huge
hand reaches from behind me and grabs my wrist.  "Well, what have we here?"
a stern voice booms out.  I twist around to see who it is, but the
arm of my captor recedes into the darkness and all I can see are
shadows.

<p>"What do you want from me?" I scream.

<p>"Ah, ah, ah!"  Swipe!  Swipe!  Swipe!  Swipe!  Swipe!

<p>And then a loud bell rang and woke me up.  My alarm clock.  Without
opening my eyes, I reached out to silence it, but ended up with
somebody's face in my hand.  "Ouch!  Watch it!" somebody snarled.

<p>I opened my eyes.  It was pitch black.  A general rustling
told me that people were getting up.  "Kerry?" I asked.

<p>"Over here."

<p>I groped in that direction and found an arm.  "Kerry?" I asked again.

<p>"Yeah.  Take my hand and stay close.  We usually split up from
here and take different routes to the hiding place.  But tonight
you'll stick with me."

<p>My stomach was doing somersaults; I couldn't tell if it was from the
food or the dream.  I rose shakily to my feet and followed Kerry
out of the room, down the hall, and out into the night.

<p>Nobody spoke.  Hardly a sound was made as people scattered from the
school grounds.  Kerry and I loped through back yards, into my old
neighborhood.  As we approached the drainage ditch, the factory
whistle shrieked the shift change.  We crossed the drainage ditch, and
slowed down as we entered the forest.  I crunched a leaf, and Kerry
stopped.  He put his mouth to my ear and whispered, "Be careful where
you step."  I found that I could barely make out the ground under the
crescent moon and I was more careful.  The air was cool and fresh and
there was a slight breeze.  The only sound was the occasional rustle
of leaves dancing in the trees.

<p>We were part of the night.  Thieves.  Invisible.

<p>We came to a particularly thick patch of thorny undergrowth.  Kerry
slid his hand under a branch and lifted; a whole section of the
thicket rose with it, like a door.  I crawled in first and Kerry
followed.  Just on the other side of the thicket was a small clearing
surrounding a tree.  Teresa was already there.

<p>"Hi Kim," she whispered, "this is our hiding place.  We usually hide
here till dawn.  Rich is up in the tree being the lookout.  Put your
hand right here."  She guided my hand to a dark piece of string.
"The lookout will give the string two tugs if somebody is getting
close and we have to be quiet.  If we're about to be discovered,
he pulls the string all the way up the tree.  We then scatter
in different directions."

<p>I looked up into the tree but I couldn't see Rich.  "What does the
lookout do if somebody comes?"

<p>"He just sits tight.  It's probably the safest place to be since the
rest of us are running and the second shifters will chase us.  We've
only had to run once and nobody got caught.  That's pretty good for
three years."

<p>Kerry whispered, "We take turns being lookout.  Since you're new, you
can go after Rich.  The moon will still be up which will help you to
see.  Then I'll go, and Teresa will take the early dawn."

<p>We sat for a few minutes, holding the string.  Then I
whispered to Kerry, "What's it like being a second shifter?"

<p>"I'm not sure.  I don't think their jobs are any different.  The guy who
relieves me runs the same machine I do.  Obviously their hours are
different.  And, of course, they're on the other side of the flashlight."

<p>"Is there a third shift?" I asked.

<p>"Of course.  They're on duty now.  The machines run continuously."

<p>"Do they eat and sleep in the same place we do?"

<p>"No.  They have special quarters in the upper floors of the factory.
I think they have special food too.  But nobody knows much about them.
Not even the second shifters.  I've asked."

<p>After a few moments, I asked, "I still don't understand why there's all
this hiding and seeking.  Are the second shifters just being mean?"

<p>"Oh, no.  It's the rules, that's all.  They have a quota to fill each
month; so many first shifters found and taken back to the plant.  When
they've filled their quota, they go easy for the rest of the month."

<p>"Who makes the rules?"

<p>Kerry shrugged.  "I dunno.  Maybe third shift?"

<p>I was quiet for another few moments.  Then Kerry said, "How about if you
climb up and relieve Rich.  I'll be up a little later to relieve you.
We try to keep the lookout shifts short to keep sharp."

<p>I nodded and climbed up the tree.  About twenty feet up, I found Rich
on a thick branch.  He whispered to me, "If anybody gets past the
drainage ditch, give the string two tugs.  Even if it's a first shifter.
You see that big evergreen about fifty feet away?"  I nodded.  "If
anybody gets past that, haul the string up and hold your breath."

<p>"OK" I whispered, and Rich climbed down.  I could see quite a ways
from that high up.  The factory had light blazing from its windows
and smoke still billowing from its stacks.  Every once in a while, I
saw a flashlight blink on and off somewhere in the nearby
neighborhoods.

<p>After about twenty minutes, I saw two shadows emerge from behind the
last house on my block.  They moved along the ditch toward the street.
A flashlight blinked on, stabbed into the forest, and then blinked
off.  I gave the string two tugs.  One of the shadows descended into
the weeds of the ditch near the street.  Suddenly there was a violent
thrashing among the weeds.  The shadow still on the street turned on
the flashlight again and probed the ditch.

<p>Two figures broke from the ditch, one slightly ahead of the other,
both running toward the last house.  My heart skipped a few beats when
I realized that the first shifter had been hiding in the same cave
that Fred and I had used the night before.  It looked like the first
shifter was running faster and would get away.  Then I noticed that the
guy on the street was swinging something over his head.  He let go and
I could hear a faint metallic jingle as the thing arched through the
air and caught the first shifter in the knees.  He went down.

<p>"Kerry!"  Fred's voice rang out from the crumpling figure.

<p>My heart froze.  I watched in horror as the two second shifters
reached Fred and started pummeling him with their still-lighted
flashlights.  For the first few moments, screams erupted from the
fray, then they suddenly stopped.  But the beating still continued.
After what seemed like an eternity, the second shifters examined the
now-inert Fred, and then all was dark again.  I could barely see the
two second shifters dragging Fred away.

<p>I felt faint and had to hug the tree to keep from falling.  I had
assumed that getting caught would result in loosing a few work hours
or something.  To hell with this; I was quitting.  I climbed back down
from the tree.

<p>"What are you doing?"  Kerry hissed, "You were up there for less than
an hour!"

<p>"I'm out of here.  Didn't you hear Fred cry out?  They caught him and
beat him up real bad.  You guys can play your little game if you want,
but you can count me out."

<p>Kerry paused, then nudged Rich who climbed the tree.  "Fred was right,
you sure <em>don't</em> know much," he said.

<p>"So what happens to Fred now?" I asked.

<p>Nobody said anything.  Kerry crawled to the other side of the tree.
Still not satisfied, I turned to Teresa.  "Well?"

<p>She looked at me, and in the dim moonlight I could see tears streaming
down her face.  My anger melted into dread.  She said, "They take
his body to the factory for processing."
Processing?  Like embalming and burial?  Teresa continued, "we'll never
see him again."

<p>Kerry poked his head around the tree.  "Oh, we'll see him again all right,"
he spat, "tomorrow morning at breakfast!"

<p>The beige strips.

<p>My stomach and throat tightened and I could taste bile.  I turned and
vomited into the bushes.  I vaguely heard a "shhh", but I paid no
attention.  My stomach was twisted into a hard knot and my head was
spinning chaotically.  Then, one thought pushed its way through the
confusion - the shack.

<p>I bolted out of the clearing, thorny branches clawing at
my cheeks.  Part of me cringed at the noise I was making, but pure
red panic overwhelmed all caution.  In less than a minute, I cleared the forest
and blundered into the drainage ditch, smacking my face
into the mud.  I clawed my way up the other side
and started down the street.

<p>Remembering the second shifters, I angled toward the houses.  As I
neared the second house, a flashlight beam hit me from behind.
I veered slightly so that I was running directly toward the house.
But only for a second.  Suddenly, I dodged left
and ran parallel to the house.  A second later I heard the sound of a
heavy chain smashing into the side of the house.  But the flashlight
beam was still on me.

<p>I had been running full bore for about two minutes and I was
definitely slowing down.  I ducked between the houses and rounded the
corner into the back yard.  There was the shack, dead ahead.  My side
hurt like a knife wound, slowing me down even more.  As I approached
the shack, I could hear feet pounding behind me.

<p>As fast as I could, I ran straight into the shack.  And once again
crashed into the back wall.  Almost the same instant, the second
shifter crashed into me.  I threw myself down to the right and heard a
dull thunk of something hard hitting the wall where I had just been.
But he had the back of my sweatshirt; I pulled him down with me.

<p>No paint cans or drop cloths were in my way, but the second shifter
had my legs.  I kicked him in the face and twisted free.  Scrambling
forward, I hit my head on the right wall.  The second shifter was
groping for me, so I drew my knees under me and rolled, till I bumped
into the front wall.  Then I leaped to the door and dashed out.

<p>And stopped.

<p>It was daylight outside.  The sun was a yellow-orange ball, dimly
visible through a layer of yellowish clouds.  All the trees were dead
and bare.  The grass was gone.  The few remaining houses were were
black.  And it was HOT!  It had to be over 100 degrees.  The air
seared my throat and lungs and my eyes burned like fire.

<p>"Ugh!"  I turned and barely saw through my tears that the second
shifter was staggering out of the shed.  The shock of seeing a
different world made him forget about me, and he just stood there with
his mouth open.

<p>I edged around him and stood for a second in the doorway of the shack,
looking at the second shifter.  He was still staring at the desolate
landscape.  I planted my foot on the seat of his pants and pushed.  As
he fell forward, I stepped into the shed.

<p>It occurred to me that both trips through the shed had been a circuit
in a clockwise direction.  Perhaps I could turn back the hands of time
by going counter-clockwise.  I was a little afraid of changing any
other aspects of my previous trips, so I dutifully, but gently, bumped
my head against the back wall, the <em>left</em> wall, and the front wall.
Then I stepped to the door.

<p>I peeked out and saw the other second shifter standing with his back to
the door, shining his flashlight around the back yards.

<p>"Bill!  Where the Hell are you?" he called.

<p>As quietly as I could, I made one more circuit and peeked out again.

<p>It was a heavy August evening - hot, humid, and close.  A full moon
tried to burn its way through a hazy sky.

<p>"ALLEE ALLEE IN FREE!  KIM!  WHERE ARE YOU?"  It was Lee.

<p>I walked unsteadily back to my house.  My throat and lungs still
burned, making it difficult for me to breath.  Tears still seeped
out of my eyes.  As I approached the front porch, my mom was already at the
door, arms folded, foot tapping.  Lee took a step toward me, saying "Where 
in the world were you?  All of us were looking ..."

<p>I stepped into the pool of light around our porch and everybody's
mouths fell open.  "I kinda had an accident" I croaked.

<p>"Kim..." my mom said as I trudged into the house.

<p>"I'm OK Mom, but I'm real tired.  I'm going to take a shower and go to
bed."

<p>I scrubbed especially hard where the second shifter had grabbed my
legs.

<p>The next morning, I got some funny looks, but nobody asked me any
questions about the previous night.  Which is good since I still
hadn't thought of a credible lie about where the sweatshirt and shoes
came from.

<p>I didn't play much more hide and seek that summer.  I <em>did</em> try the
shed again, first trying to go back in time, then trying to go
anywhere.  It didn't work.

<p>In the fall, I enrolled in a junior college, which led to a state
university, which led to marriage and a job.  Now I guess I'm actually
living the "living death" I once feared.  But freedom is a relative
thing.  Every time I'm feeling trapped by my bland life, I look at my
work card and I realize that I've got enough freedom to get by.
