<p>Want to take a walk down Lachman Lane?  I don't have much, but here it
is.

<p>If anybody out there wants to contribute some factual (or even
semi-factual) information about the old Lachman, the takeover, or its
current existance (such as it is), then let me know and I'll include it.

<h2><a name=Lbl1>
My Start at Lachman</a></h2>

<p>In the spring of 1994, I was unhappy with my Siemens job of 11 years (which is
<em>more</em> than forever for a software developer).  That was the year that
the Chicago area was treated to an
<a href="eclipse.html">annular eclipse</a>
of the sun.  I had prepared for the occasion by constructing a
pin-hole viewer about three feet long.  Then, over lunch, I spent a
happy hour outside, watching the day turn an eerie semi-dark as the
magic ring appeared in my viewer.

<p>There were probably 20 other employees out that day (out of almost
1000), most of them with welding goggles.  I think mine was one of two
or three home-made viewers; it was certainly the geekiest one.

<p>A little later that day, I telephoned my wife, Karen, who was working for a
company called Lachman Technology.  She told me that the entire
workforce of Lachman spent the eclipse having a company-sponsored pizza
eating and eclipse viewing party.  About half of the engineers had
home-made viewers, the other half used the milar glasses that the
company owner (Ron Lachman) got from the Chicago Planetarium.

<p>It was at that moment that I knew that I was working for the wrong
company.  A couple of months later, I was working at Lachman.

Where Is Lachman Now?</a></h2>

<p>Alas, Lachman (the company) is no more - it has been eaten by
Computer Associates.
However, Ron Lachman is still alive and kicking.  See
<a href="http://www.lachman.org">http://www.lachman.org</a> and
<a href="http://www.flashback.com/www/september.1995/flashback/1361.uninews.2.2.html">http://www.flashback.com/www/september.1995/flashback/1361.uninews.2.2.html</a>.
The last time I talked with him, he had his fingers in 4 or 5
different companies.

<h2><a name=Lbl3>
Host Names</a></h2>

<p>Many people fondly remember the many strange host names that populated
the network.  Ted Kekatos was kind enough to supply a
<a href="lai_hosts.txt">partial list</a>.
If your favorite one isn't here, lemme know and I'll add it.  Notice
that many of them contain the letters L A I (the initials of the first
incarnation of Lachman - "Lachman Associates Inc").

<h2><a name=Lbl4>
Ex-lachman List</a></h2>

<p>Even though I was only with Lachman for about a year and a half, I
somehow ended up maintaining the ex-lachman mailing list.

<p>The list is at:

<pre>
  http://www.geeky-boy.com/ ex-lti&nbsp;.html
</pre>

<p>Be sure to remove the
spaces in the name; I stuck them in there to foil search engines and
junk mailers' address harvesters.  Feel free to bookmark that URL, but
PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY LINKS TO IT
IN ANY OF YOUR PAGES.

<h2><a name=Lbl5>
Use of List</a></h2>

<p>I have, on a few occasions, received mail from ex-lachman people
expressing concern about the various uses of the mailing list.  I have
set up a system of preferences for each member.  Each message is
identified according to a fixed set of categories, and members can
opt out of one or more categories.

<p>Please e-mail back to me if you wish to NOT receive one or more of the
following categories of mail:

<ul>
<li>NOUPDATES - don't send me updates to the list.  One can always
use the web page to look somebody up, but keep in mind that it
is not complete - some people have requested to be removed from the
web-based list.

<li>NOJOBS - don't send me notices of available job positions.

<li>NOLOOKING - don't send me notices of somebody looking for a job.

<li>NOINVITES - don't send me notices of get-togethers (picnics, parties, etc).

<li>NOEVENTS - don't send me notices of births, deaths, marriages, and other
significant events in our members' lives.

<li>NOADMIN - don't send me messages having to do with the administration
of the list.  (This survey counts as an ADMIN message.)

<li>NOMISC - don't send me stuff that doesn't fit into the above categories.
(e.g. "Does anybody out there know the answer to this question?")

<li>NONE - keep me on the list, but don't send me anything.  Ever.  I HATE
e-mail, and I never want to receive another one as long as I live!  In
fact, I hate people who SEND e-mail!!!  They're all a bunch of techno-
dweebs who have no lives and need the...
</ul>

<p>*SMACK*

<p>Oof!  Uh, thanks.  I needed that.

<p>If I don't hear from you, I will leave you open to receiving anything.

<p>Finally, some people have asked me about the possibility of setting up
a way that individual members could send messages to the list without
going through me.  I would password-protect it, and require that the
sender supply a category keyword (UPDATE, JOBS, LOOKING, etc).

<p>I would like to know how many people out there has wished for this in
the past and think it would be a Good Idea (tm).

<h2><a name=Lbl6>
Note: "Public" Lists Not Complete</a></h2>

<p>The web copy of this mailing list is not complete.
Some people prefer not to have their addresses published to the
general public.  IMHO the risk of an "undesirable" finding it is
small, especially since I've made the list inaccessable by search
engines and address harvesters, but I'll still respect everybody's
wishes.  I will continue to distribute the FULL list via e-mail 
to the members of the list.  Let me know if you would prefer not to be
included in the public list.
