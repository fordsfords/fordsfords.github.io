<h1>Dave's Quest of Epic Proportion</h1>

<p>Friday, October 2, 2007

<p><b>WARRENVILLE, IL (AP)</b> -- In a scene reminiscent Diogenes' search for an honest man, Dave Zabel of Hoffman Estates was found Thursday, wandering the directories of a local software company in search of a comment.

<p>"People here have lots to say, but they don't seem to comment on much.  At this point, I'd be happy with pretty much anything anything.  'Nice weather' would do," lamented Zabel as he opened yet another source file.

<p>Mark Mahowald, president and CEO of 29West was not immediately available for comment.  However, co-worker Eric Bowden didn't understand what all the fuss was about.  "I think we're a pretty transparent crowd - dare I say 'self-commenting'."  When asked by this reporter to elaborate, he simply shrugged.

<p>As his search continues, Zabel seemed philosophical about the situation.  "I've been in worse situations.  At least they've got free soda here."
