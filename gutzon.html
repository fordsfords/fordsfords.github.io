Gutzon Borglum - 'He Carved the Rock'
</h1>

<hr>

<p>For those of you who weren't awake much during American History,
Gutzon Borglum was the ... uh ... is "artist" the right word?
Anyway, he's the guy who sculpted the dead presidents' faces on Mount
Rushmore.  Now, I gotta admit - that's no mean feat.  But <em>really</em>
now, why does there have to be a sign every 10 miles advertising the
Gutzon Borglum museum?

<p>The signs themselves are interesting.  They're not bill boards.
Instead, somebody collected a bunch of big trailers (an 18-wheeler
semi minus the cab) that I presume weren't usable any more.  Those
trailers were parked along the road and the sign was painted right on
the side of the trailer.

<p>Some of them are <em>really</em> broken down, and it gives the whole thing a
very cheezy feel.  It's pretty obvious that they traded quality for
quantity.  All this for a <em>museum</em> for goodness sake!  Lets just say that
we decided to leave Gutzon for a future trip.

<p>And while we're at it, I guess I have to confess that I must not be
much of a patriot.  Karen and I debated blowing off Mt. Rushmore
all together.  But we decided that doing so would be considered child
abuse in most states, so we went there.  And granted, my son was
pretty impressed with the scale of the thing.  But come ON now ... I
prefer to have dead presidents' faces on little pieces of green paper.

<p>On the other hand, the
<a href="badlands.html">Badlands National Park</a>,
Wind Cave, and Jewel
Cave (all of which are all easy drives from Mt. Rushmore) were <em>WELL</em> worth
the trip.  E-mail me for details if you're interested.
