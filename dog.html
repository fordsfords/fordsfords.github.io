<p>8:30 PM.

<p>Jack stumbled forward straining at the leash, trying to slow Jill
down. Not an easy task considering that Jill is a 75 pound Syberian
husky, a present from a former girlfriend who thought "Jack and
Jill" was the funniest thing she had ever heard. Jill was
understandably excited; so many sights and smells, the wide open
spaces beckoning to her.

<p>Their nightly dance followed its usual course - 2 blocks to a small
park where Jill could be unleashed to work off her energy. It always
seemed to take 3 hours to make it back home again, and like every night, Jack
swore that he would limit tonight's romp to a half hour.

<p>They reached the park entrance and Jack started to unhook Jill, who could
hardly contain herself during the 5 seconds it took. Why do people
have to take so long?

<p>"OK, Jill, have fun." Jack only got as far as the initial "O" before
she took off, full speed into the small wooded area ahead. She
flushed out a squirrel which dashed up a tree. She explored a
rotting log that smelled of musk and rain. Then she ran into the
small sandy playground where Jack was strolling.

<p>They played "tag" for a short while (although Jack spent the whole
time being "it"). Then Jill caught an interesting scent in the far
corner of the sandlot. A familiar scent, just under the sand.

<p>With a cloud of sand spraying into the air, Jill dug rapidly
downward toward the scent. Suddenly, Jill recognized the smell and
stopped digging. She looked quizzically up a Jack who was ambling
toward her. "What's up, old girl? Find a bone?"

<p>Jill looked back and forth a few times and then resumed digging,
slower this time. Jack reached the hole and squatted down to look
in. "Whatcha got down there, old..." Jack froze at the sight of the
top of a human head. "Oh, my God..."

<p>Jill continued to excavate; a forehead, eyes, and a nose slowly came
into view. Jack felt faint, a buzzing in his ears. He sat down
heavily next to the hole and stared in horror as his own face
emerged from the sand.

<p>Jill stopped momentarily and looked at Jack's stupified trance, and
then continued the dig in a frenzy. Torso, arms, waist, and legs
slowly appeared in the shallow grave. An unresponsive Jack sat and
stared blankly at a newly uncovered Jack.

<p>Jill then clamped the body's shirt collar in her jaws and pulled and
tugged until the body was laying prone next to the hole. She let go
and ran back to the seated Jack, still staring into the hole. She
circled Jack a few times, whining.

<p>But the sand under Jack was slowly giving way, and suddenly Jack
tipped forward and tumbled into the hole, the sides falling in and
partly covering him. A cowering Jill backed slowly away from the
hole, returned to the prone Jack, and tentatively sniffed his face.

<p>Jack's face twitched as Jill's whiskers tickled his nose. Jack then
sneezed violently and sat up, sending Jill skittering back. Jack
looked around ... it was quite dark and he could see little among
the dark shadows of the park. He squinted at his watch, pressing the
button which illuminated the numbers. 11:15. DAMN! He had fallen
asleep again!

<p>Jack stood up, brushing the sand from his clothes and hair. "Come
here, Jill. Come on girl." Jill returned to Jack and let herself be
re-leashed. Then, with Jill still whining, they started walking home.

<p>As the night wore on, the wind blew steadily, and the hole in the
playground slowly filled in.
