<h1>Loch Ness Monster Sighted in London</h1>

<p><b>LONDON, England (AP)</b> -- "Nessie's on vacation" is what a lot of
Londoners are saying these days.  For the past few weeks, reports have
been trickling in of a large green creature causing minor chaos in the
underground.

<p>"I didn't get a good look at him, but he was big," reported one regular of
the Circle line.  "Really big.  And green, with a bit of yellow and white.
Took up half the car, he did.  Me wife, she thinks he's all fun and
excitement.  Meself, I think it's all just a big nuisance."

<p>The tube workers see him as more than a nuisance,
however.  "Our first concern is the safety of our ridership," said
Nigel Whiplash, spokesman for the London Underground public
relations.  "He seems to be friendly, but we have no idea what he
eats.  We could be losing riders right and left and not even know it.
I think he should go back to wherever he came from."

<p>But Nessie doesn't seem to be leaving anytime soon, and most
commuters seem to be taking him in stride.  Lois Nickerson, a resident
of Barbican Estates, says he's more of a pussy cat than a monster.
"I give him a smile and a nod, and he settles right down.  I think he might
be learning to talk even.  He makes the most God-awful noises, but I could
swear he said 'cheers' the other day."
