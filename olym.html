<tr><td><p>Steven Wright was stripped of his
Olympic gold medal in the hammer throw when a gross
violation of Olympic rules was discovered
early Tuesday morning.

<p>"We did all the blood tests, all the equipment
checks.  I can't believe we overlooked something
so obvious" lamented Charlene Clausen, director of
oversight oversight.  "I'm very disappointed that
he wasn't more forthcoming with his background."

<p>Steven Wright turned 42 on Tuesday, and
Olympic rules prohibit the participation of old
people.  Michael Garwood, chief admissions officer
for Olympic track and field events, says that the
age rule is intended for the health and safety of
the participants.  "You know those geezers.  They
could fall down and break a hip.  Or have a heart
attack.  I wouldn't want that to happen on my watch."

<p>Steve Ford, president of AARP, protested the
rules, claiming that the Olympic officials were
just pandering to public pressure.  "It's age discrimination,
pure and simple.  Nobody wants to see our flabby bodies
bouncing around the track, showing those young whippersnappers
that we've still got what it takes.  Why, in my day
people showed some respect for the elderly!  Did you
know that the Eskimos worship us like gods?  Gods, I say!
Why, I'll arm wrestle you!  Right now!  Come on, let's see
what you're made of!"  (This reporter politely declined
the offer.)

<p>Steven Wright was unavailable for comment immediately
following the stripping ceremony, preferring instead to
hobble to his walker and slowly make his way to his
Oldsmobile.
