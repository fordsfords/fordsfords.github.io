<p><i>It's time for the Continuing Adventures of Borris, the Amazing Talking Dog!
<br>
<br>Brought to you this week by the American Association of Investment Bankers.
<br>You know, stuffing your money in a mattress may feel safer than a bank, but have
<br>you ever thought about the toxic gasses emitted from large amounts of currency?
<br>There are probably dozens of studies on the chemicals used in the ink
<br>used by the U.S. Mint, and we bet they're all pretty scary.
<br>So keep your children safe by using regular mattresses and investing
<br>your money with American Investment Bankers.
<br>The life you save might just be your own.

<p><i><a href="b88.html">The story so far...</a></i>

<p><i>We join Borris now for episode 90: The Hack.</i>

<b>
<p>Detective Frostworth closes his notepad and surveys the piles of dead
<br>henchmen, thugs, goons, lackeys, minions, and ring leaders surrounding him.
<br>He had seen the worst that the city could throw at him; had become immune to
<br>the senseless death and destruction.
<br>Some in the department thought his soul was dead, but Frostworth knew it
<br>was just buried deep under layers of the city's filth and depravity.
<br>But this scene ... this scene got to him.

<p>He turns to Borris.  "OK, off the record.
<br>I get how you lured the 5 biggest government-agency-turned-narco-trafficing
<br>rings here on the promise of untraceable military-grade data disruption technology,
<br>but I still don't understand how you decrypted those hard drives in the middle of
<br>the firefight from Hell.
<br>Have you no fear?"

<p>Borris scratches his shoulder abstractly, his hind leg thumping
<br>rhythmically on the floor.
<br>"I'm thirsty.  There any toilets around here?"

<p>Frostworth nods his head tiredly.  "Sure kid, you've earned that much."
</b>

<p><i>Will Frostworth beat the trumped-up corruption charges against him?
<br>What did Trump tell Frostworth in the secret meeting?
<br>Will Borris order takeout tonight?
