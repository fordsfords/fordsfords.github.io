<p><i>We join Borris now for episode 91: The Heart of the Matter.</i>

<p>Michelle toys with her glass of wine, gazing piercingly into its burgundy depths.
<br>"I'm sorry to be so weak, Borris.  I've just never seen John so scared.
<br>And who can blame him? The last three CEOs of Evercorp died shortly after taking over.
<br>And now John gets promoted!

<p>"I mean, is it really a coincidence that the exact same coffee maker would
<br>explode three times in three months?
<br>I think the board knows more than they're letting on.
<br>I think John should just walk away.
<br>But he thinks that would put him at even greater danger!
<br>It's tearing him apart, and I don't know how to help him!

<p>"What should I do?"

<p>Borris winks first one eye, then the other.
<br>"You got any squeak toys I could chew on?"

<p>Tears of relief fill Michelle's eyes.
<br>"Oh Borris, you always know exactly what to say."

<p><i>Will Aerosmith really break up after 45 years together?
<br>Does Joanie still love Chachi after 35 years?
<br>Do the Xenon isotopes in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko really show that
<br>comets contributed to Earth's atmosphere, or is it all a ruse to hide
<br>EverCorp's true intentions?
<br>Tune in next week for more exciting adventures of Borris, the Amazing Talking Dog!</i>
