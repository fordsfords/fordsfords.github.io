<p>Being fresh out of eye-of-newt, the four sorcerers considered

<p>Linda cried, "No, mushrooms!"
<p>Margaret excitedly offered, "Let's do nuts and bolts!"
<p>Steve was looking at his laptop. Margaret nudged him. "Huh?
Oh yeah, how about lines of code?"
<br>

<p>Which do you choose?
<ul>
<li><a href="2.html">Cacti</a>
<li><a href="3.html">Mushrooms</a>
<li><a href="4.html">Nuts and bolts</a>
<li><a href="5.html">Lines of code</a>
</ul>
