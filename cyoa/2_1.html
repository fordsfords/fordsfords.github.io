<p>Celia closed her eyes and imagined a strip of
crispy, delicious bacon.

<p>"Veggies are great, fruities are fine.
<br>"Doggies would rather have bacon to dine.
<br>"Linda come back, I'm making a sign
<br>"To make human what once was lupine!"

<p>A loud bang, and everybody looked at Linda....
<p>... who was still a dog.
<p>Another bang, and the door opened.
There stood a naked man with short, sandy hair
and a confused expression on his face.

<p>He looked around the room, saw Linda,
and growled.
<p>Celia stared. "Mac?"
<p>Mac looked at Celia and started jumping
up and down.
<p>Steve threw his hands over his eyes. "Could somebody please
throw a blanket over him?"
<p>Margaret took a quilt off the sofa
and wrapped it around Mac.
He curled up on the sofa and went
to sleep.

<p>"I've still got some nuts and bolts," said Margaret.
<p>"I think I'll sit this one out," moaned Celia.
<p>"I've got a clock spell," offered Steve.

<p>Which do you choose?
<ul>
<li><a href="2_1_1.html">Nuts and bolts.</a>
<li><a href="2_1_2.html">Clock.</a>
</ul>
