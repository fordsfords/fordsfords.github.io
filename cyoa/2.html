<p>Celia drew a cactus from her flowing robes.
"Thanks, this was getting uncomfortable."
She tossed the cactus into the caldron.

<p>A blinding flash of green light leaves everybody
blinking. "Whoa," said Linda, "that was ruff."

<p>Steve was still blinking. "You mean bright."

<p>"Ruff. Ruff ruff. Woof."

<p>Everybody looked at Linda, but she was gone.
In her place was a dog.

<p>Steve clapped his hands. "Oh, I always wanted
a dog! C'mere girl!" He held out his hand.

<p>Linda growled. Steve thought better of it.

<p>Celia said, "Guys, Mac doesn't like other dogs.
We've got to fix this before he gets back from
his walk!
I know a good bacon spell, that might help."

<p>Margaret turned to Celia. "I thought you were off
bacon!"

<p>Celia shrugged. "It's for a good cause."

<p>Margaret said, "Well, I've got a nice egg spell I can try."

<p>Steve looked doubtful. "I think I should cast a paper spell."

<p>Which do you choose?
<ul>
<li><a href="2_1.html">Bacon spell</a>
<li><a href="2_2.html">Egg spell</a>
<li><a href="2_3.html">Paper spell</a>
</ul>
