Politics as Usual - Background
</h1>

<hr>

<p>I have been using a public-access Unix system called <a
href="/">chinet</a> for a number of years now.  I mostly
use the conferencing system (BBS - kindof like local news groups) to
talk to the other chinet users.  The "Politics as Usual" story features
a number of those chinet users.

<p>saj is a scientist who works for Quaker Oats and loves violent
computer games. One such game is "doom".

<p>duffy is arguably the strangest person on the board - he
has bleached hair with raccoon stripes on his pony tale, is gay (at least
sometimes he is), and has a VERY
wild imagination. He has written several bizarre stories for the board.
In one, he wrote being an otter (hence "alderotter"). He can also be quite
vicious if he gets into an electronic fight.  He also did a lot to inspire
me to start writing, so in a way I owe him a debt.  Or else an appology.

<p>hobbit and jonnie are teenagers (or were back when I wrote the
story).  hobbit has gotten into a few electronic fights with duffy,
and there were a few occasions when jonnie tried to calm feathers.

<p>billv is a pompous, egotistical, know-it-all that few people seem to
like.

<p>Then there's randy. He is the owner and sysop of the chinet. He
claims that he is OLD, OLD, OLD (I think he's in his fifties). He
has been married a few times, but he has always claimed to never
get any sex.  In a world of smartasses, his ass can be smarter than
most.  He has very little patience with people who pretend to know more
than they really do, and many of his posts are piercing one-liners that
deflate overblown egos.

<p>Hendrix is a fictional character in a popular serial story on the
board.

<p>And a Timb is a character in a different serial story
- a small creature, perhaps a foot tall, intelligent. For some
reason, humans are annoyed by Timbs and are trying to exterminate
them.
