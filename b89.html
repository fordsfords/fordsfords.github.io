<p>Suddenly, the door is shredded to confetti by automatic gun fire.
<br>Svetlana and her thugs drop like anvils.
<br>Sam Strychnine, leader of an ex-CIA-turned-rival-narco-trafficing
<br>ring swaggers confidently into the room, flanked by his own goons.
<br>He glances at the beautiful but dead Svetlana, and then locks eyes with Borris.

<p>"Huh.  I expected the skirt, but what da hell are <i>you</i> doin' here, Borris?"

<p>Borris sniffs disdainfully at the thick odor of gunsmoke and fresh blood.
"Can I sniff your butt"?

<p>Sam hesitates, then turns savagely on his goons.
"OUT!  GET OUTTA HERE!  Me and da dog gots tings ta discuss!"

<p><i>Will Borris finally settle the score with Sam?
<br>Will Sam discover the secret between Janet and the congressional hearing?
<br>Will Borris ever get his dinner?
