notice.  It can be found at

<p>&lt;DISCLAIMER&gt;

<p>Most of what I do, say, and think is probably wrong. If you risk you life,
health, property or finances based on something I write, then you're a fool.
Remember, this is the internet - just because I try to sound like an
expert doesn't mean that I am one.  If I were educated and had learned Latin,
I would say, "<i>caveat emptor</i>."  But I wasn't and didn't,
and therefore won't.
