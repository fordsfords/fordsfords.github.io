<h1>Sford's Seder</h1>
<p>I wrote this Seder with a lot of help.  Help in the form of plagerism.
I *thought* I had written down the sources, but I can't seem to find them.
I'll keep looking.  Just be aware that very little of what is contained
here is original work.

<p>Also, this was written when first Seder fell on Saturday night, so it
includes a Havdalah (section 0.4).  Omit this for Seders that fall on a
different night.  (And if it falls on Friday night, you're on your own.
I don't know what all should be added.)

<p>I <em>thought</em> I remember this Seder as being pretty kid-friendly.
But upon re-reading parts of it now, I see that it's not.  I wrote it
mostly to avoid having to skip back and forth between several Haggadot,
and also in response to what I saw as some terrible oppression of the
Palestinians by the Israeli government.  The only bow to it being kid-friendly
is that it is shorter than a full traditional Haggadah.  I want to do
some serious work to it before I could consider it a good "family" Seder.

<p>Finally, be aware that this was thrown together somewhat hurriedly.
I left a fair amount out.  For example, the following sections are
completely empty and were done from a traditional hagadah:
<pre>
    11 Tzafun
    11.1 Afikoman
    12 Barech
    12.1 Blessings after meal
    13 Hallel
    13.1 Psalms of praise
    13.2 Who knows one?
    13.3 Chad Gadya
</pre>

<h2>0 Introduction</h2>
<p>We come to this Seder as Jews committed to Jewish survival and to the survival of the State of Israel.  Jews have been persecuted and exterminated throughout history, and we Jews today are living proof of God's love for us, as well as the bravery, dedication, and persistence of our ancestors.
<p>Abraham listened to God and left his home and most of his family and friends to start a new nation.  Although the writing of the Torah was still many generations away, Abraham represents the beginnings of the "Chosen People" - people who would raise ethical behavior to a new level and serve as a light unto the nations.
<p>We Jews are children of Abraham, and it is our responsibility to live up to the moral and ethical teachings of our faith.  But we are not the only children of Abraham.  Isaac had a brother - Ishmael.  We at this table are brothers and sisters of Muslims throughout the world - Egyptians, Jordanians, Saudis, Syrians, and Palestinians.
<p>Tonight we celebrate freedom - freedom to live, freedom to worship, freedom to act according to the moral and ethical teachings of God.  We also have a responsibility.  We must work to bring freedom to all people ... especially those brothers and sisters with whom we are inextricably tied - the Palestinians.
<h2>0.1 Hiney ma tov uma na-im, shevet achim gam yachad.</h2>
<p>How good and pleasant for brothers to dwell in harmony.
<h2>0.2 Blessings over Yom Tov candles</h2>
<p>Baruch atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha'olam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvo'tav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner shel yom tov.  Blessed art thou oh Lord our God, king of the universe, who has sanctified us with your commandments and commanded us to light the festival lights.
<h2>0.3 She'hecheyanu</h2>
<p>Baruch atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha'olam, she'hecheyanu v'kiy'menu v'higi'anu laz'man hazeh.  Blessed art thou oh Lord our God, king of the universe, for giving us life, sustaining us, and enabling us to reach this festival season.
<p>God, please inspire all Jewish and Palestinian people and leaders to take the difficult steps to bring peace to the region.  Bring us the understanding that the vast majority of people on both sides do not want war; we just want to live our lives without hurting our neighbors.  Help us to overcome generations of mistrust and hatred and find common ground.  Teach us the humility to admit that we have sinned against our brothers and sisters - we have been unnecessarily harsh and even cruel and spiteful.  Give us the courage to ask forgiveness.  Heal the deep wounds we have suffered at the hands of our reluctant adversaries so that we may forgive them their sins.  You have directed us to do these things in both the Torah and the Koran - please remind us that you really mean it.
<h2>0.4 Havdalah (skip wine & spices, use Yom Tov candles)</h2>
<p>On most Saturday nights, we have a special service called Havdalah, during which we recite prayers over wine, spices, and special braided candles.  One purpose of Havdalah is to help us through the transition between the holy day of Shabbat and an ordinary day.  Since tonight we are simply moving from one holy day to another, we recite an abbreviated version.
<p>Baruch atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha'olam, boray m'orai ha-aish.  Blessed art thou oh Lord our God, king of the universe, who creates the lights of fire.
<h2>1 Kadesh</h2>
<h2>1.1 First cup of wine - the cup of security</h2>
<p>The Talmud says, "A person who does not own a piece of land is not a secure person."  We raise this first cup of wine in acknowledgment of the legitimate desires of each people to lead a secure life - a life free from fear - secure in the knowledge that they have a land, a land from which they cannot be driven.  We conduct this Seder in the belief that the security is attainable.
<p>Baruch atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha'olam, boray p'ri hagafen.  Blessed art thou oh Lord our God, king of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine.

<h2>2 Urchatz</h2>
<h2>2.1 Wash hands (no blessing)</h2>

<h2>3 Karpas</h2>
<h2>3.1 Rebirth and renewal</h2>
<p>Dip a piece of parsley in salt water.
<p>Baruch atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha'olam, boray p'ri hadamah.  Blessed art thou oh Lord our God, king of the universe, who creates the fruit of the earth.
<p>Eat the parsley.

<h2>4 Yachatz</h2>
<p>Break the middle matzah.  Put the smaller half back in the middle and hold the larger half up.
<h2>4.1 Bread of affliction</h2>
<p>This is matzah, the bread of affliction which our ancestors ate in Mitzraim.
<p>Mitzraim literally means "tight places," the time of our slavery.  Today we are slaves of our fear.  Jews are slaves to the fear bred of 2,000 years of Jew hatred culminating in the Holocaust; Palestinians are slaves to the fear bred of being homeless refugees and living under an occupying power.  Fear, insecurity, is the villain - our affliction.
<p>Let all who are hungry come and eat.  Let all who are in need come and celebrate Passover.  This year we are here.  Next year we may be in the land of Israel.  This year we are slaves.  Next year we may be free.
<p>Israel is both a metaphor and a reality.  It is a metaphor for peace: next year we may all be at peace.  Israel is the reality of a land which Jews and Palestinians both want.  Next year may we share the land in peace.
<h2>4.2 Four question</h2>
<p>Why is this night different from all other nights?
<p>On all other nights we eat leavened bread or matzah, on this night we eat only matzah which reminds us of the afflictions we share.
<p>On all other nights we eat all kinds of herbs, on this night we eat bitter herbs especially to remind ourselves of the bitter suffering and pain that have marked our relationship for more than thirty years.
<p>On all other nights, we do not dip herbs at all, on this night we dip them twice to honor two peoples, the Palestinians and the Israelis, who must and will together find a path to mutual respect and coexistence.
<p>On all other nights we are seated or recline when we eat, on this night we only recline, in anticipation of the day in the future when we will no longer need to brace ourselves against the stranger, and will be able truly to relax together.
<h2>4.3 Four children</h2>
<p>The Haggadah speaks of four kinds of children: wise, wicked, simple, and ignorant.  It is important to realize that each one of us contains all four kinds of people.  God gave us wisdom, and yet we are imperfect and sometimes slip into evil.  We are all simple in our understanding of those closest to us, and we are all ignorant in our understanding of people whose language and culture are different from our own.
<p>The angry child asks, "Why should I compromise?  I've been doing nothing BUT compromising all my life!  It's their turn!"  And we answer that we choose the route of compromise because the alternative is the mutual destruction, both moral and physical, of our two peoples.  BOTH sides genuinely feel that they have compromised too much.  And yet, it is the only way.
<p>The simple child asks, "Why can't we just love each other?"  And we answer that neither of us can live as if history has not happened.  Unfortunately, too much blood has already been shed on both sides.  It takes time to build trust.
<p>The ignorant child asks, "How can they be that way?"  And we answer that we really aren't as different as we appear.  Our hopes and dreams for ourselves and our children have much in common.  Our needs for security are the same.  Our desires to be free are identical.
<p>The wise child asks, "How can we share the land in peace?"  Sometimes it seems to us that there is no answer to that question.  Sometimes we feel that it is impossible - that eventually one or both of us will have to be pushed into the sea before the land sees peace.
<p>But we must not give up hope.  It goes against our tradition, our history, and our basic nature to give in and let evil control our lives.  Surely we haven't survived thousands of years since Abraham by quitting in the face of seemingly impossible odds.  This is the noble fight; this is what God wants us to do.
<h2>5 Maggid</h2>
<h2>5.1 Passover story</h2>
<p>On Passover, we remember how God freed our ancestors from slavery more than 3,000 years ago. God reached out with "a mighty hand and an outstretched arm" and led the Israelites to freedom. Without God's help, we might still be slaves.
<p>Long before the time of Passover, Abraham began the Jewish worship of one God, instead of idols. In return, God made a covenant with Abraham that his descendants would be great and numerous, but they would become slaves in a foreign land for four hundred years and then be freed.
<p>Generations later, a famine struck Canaan, the homeland of Jacob, Abraham's grandson. Jacob led his extended family, the children of Israel, into Egypt to find a better supply of food. Beginning with the great accomplishments of Jacob's son, Joseph, the Israelites assumed an increasingly important role in Egyptian society. However, years later, a new Pharaoh came to power in Egypt. He feared the success and growing size of the Israelite population, and placed them into slavery.
<p>Our ancestors were slaves for many generations, making bricks and building cities for Pharaoh. As much as Pharaoh tried to destroy the Israelites through hard labor and slavery, their population grew. This led Pharaoh to decree that every Israelite baby boy must be drowned in the Nile River. But the Israelite midwives wouldn't follow the law and secretly hid the baby boys. One of the babies hidden was Moses.
<p>After hiding Moses for the first three months of his life, his mother placed him in a basket among the reeds of the Nile River. The basket was found by Pharaoh's daughter, who named the baby Moses, because she "drew him out of the water." Moses' sister, Miriam, watched Pharaoh's daughter find the baby and arranged to have him nursed by an Israelite midwife, who turned out to be Moses' real mother!
<p>Although Moses was adopted by Pharaoh's daughter and raised in the Egyptian palace, the time spent with his mother and family must have made quite an impression on him. He felt great compassion for the slaves and realized that he too was an Israelite. Unfortunately, in an attempt to stop a slave from being beaten, he killed an Egyptian and had to leave the country.
<p>But Moses would return to Egypt. One day, while working as a shepherd in Midian, Moses saw a bush burning in the wilderness. Strangely, the bush kept burning; it was not consumed. Moses went toward the bush and found himself in the presence of God, who told him to help free the Israelites.
<p>Moses and his brother, Aaron, told Pharaoh to free their people, but Pharaoh wouldn't listen. The Egyptians only worshipped idols and Pharaoh; they couldn't understand the existence of a God they couldn't see. Even Pharaoh thought he was a god who should be worshipped by the Egyptians.
<p>Pharaoh's worship of idols and the slavery of the Israelites led to a series of ten plagues. After some of the plagues, Pharaoh agreed to free the slaves, then changed his mind and kept them in slavery. So more plagues struck. From the Nile River turning to blood, to an intense darkness that made it impossible to see, the first nine plagues terrified the Egyptian people. But still, Pharaoh wouldn't free the slaves.
<p>It took the tenth plague, the death of the first born, to convince Pharaoh that his gods were merely statues. Pharaoh lost his first-born son in the tenth plague, causing him to realize that neither he nor his statues were gods -there was only one true God. Finally, he freed the slaves.
<p>The Israelites left Egypt, just as God had promised in the covenant with Abraham.  God promised the Egyptians would be judged (with the Ten Plagues) and that Abraham's descendants would leave a foreign land (Egypt) with great wealth. By the time of the Exodus, the 70 Israelites who entered Egypt 400 years earlier had multiplied to 600,000.
<p>In their hurry to leave Egypt, the Israelites didn't have time to let their bread rise. So they ate matzah, a flat bread. The Israelites were guided in the desert by God through a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
<p>Within a few days, they arrived at the Sea of Reeds (formerly believed to be the Red Sea). Suddenly, the Egyptian army was in hot pursuit; they wanted the Israelites to return as slaves.
<p>The Israelites were trapped, backed up against the sea. They needed a miracle and they got one. God parted the waters of the sea, with walls of water forming on either side, so the Israelites could pass safely on dry land.
<p>Meanwhile, a pillar of cloud hindered the Egyptian army's entry to the sea. As the Israelites reached dry land, the cloud lifted and the Egyptians quickly rushed in. But when Moses raised his staff, God caused the walls of the sea to collapse. The Egyptian army drowned and didn't threaten Israel for hundreds of years.

<h2>5.3 Dayeinu</h2>
<h2>5.4 Seder symbols</h2>
<p>Shankbone: Why did our ancestors eat the Pesach offering at their Seder? As a reminder that the Holy One, praised be He, passed over the Israelite dwellings in Mitzrayim, as it is written: "You shall say, 'It is the Pesach offering to Adonai, because He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Mitzrayim when He smote the Egyptians and spared our homes".
<p>Matzah: Why do we eat it? To remind ourselves that even before the dough of our ancestors had time to rise, the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, praised be He, revealed Himself and redeemed them, as it is written: "And they baked the dough which they had brought from Mitzrayim into unleavened cakes; it did not rise since they were hurried out of Mitzrayim, and they could not delay, nor had they prepared other provisions for themselves".
<p>Maror: Why do we eat it? To remind ourselves that, as it is written, the Egyptians in Mitzrayim "embittered the lives of our ancestors with hard labor, in mortar and in brick, and in every manner of drudgery in the field; and worked them ruthlessly in all their labor".
<p>In each generation, every individual should feel as though he or she had actually been redeemed from Mitzrayim, as it is said: "You shall tell your children on that day, saying, 'It is because of what Adonai did for me when I went free out of Mitzrayim'" (Exodus 13:8). For the Holy One redeemed not only our ancestors; He redeemed us with them, as it is said, "He brought us out of there, so that He might bring us to the land He promised our ancestors".
