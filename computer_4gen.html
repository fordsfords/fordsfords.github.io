<p>When you look at all the things that a computer can do, from video
games to controlling the space shuttle, it seems like the computer is
such a complicated device that no human could possibly understand it.
That turns out not to be true.  I like to think of a computer as being
kind of like a structure made out of Legos.

<p>A number of years ago, I saw a huge model of a medieval village, made
entirely out of Legos.  When seen from a distance, it was mind
boggling - how could anybody make something that huge and complicated?
But when I got close up to it, I saw that it was really quite simple.
There are only about 15 different kinds of Lego blocks, and each one
is easy to understand.  It took about 14 blocks to make one of the
village people - when I saw how it was done, I knew I could make one
of them easily.  Once you know how to make one, it's just a matter of
time (and patience) to make a hundred little people for the village.
The village buildings were also simple - four walls and a roof.  Each
big structure could be broken down into smaller sub-structures; each
sub-structure could be broken down into individual blocks.  And the
blocks were easy.

<p>A computer is the same way - it is made of billions of very simple
components, each of which is about as complicated as a light switch.
These switches can be connected in a variety of ways to make more
sophisticated structures - structures that can add, subtract,
multiply, and divide, structures that can remember thousands of
numbers or characters of text, structures that can move numbers and
text between all of the other kinds of structures.  Put a few million
of these structures together, and you have a computer.  But it is all
based on a simple switch.

<p>When computers were first invented, the switches were literally like
light switches - there were two pieces of metal which would touch each
other to complete a circuit, or would pull apart to break the circuit.
A coil of wire would move the pieces of metal back and forth,
connecting or disconnecting them as needed.  This kind of switch is
called a "relay", and the first computers had hundreds of relays.
<a href="http://video.cs.vt.edu:90/history/Images/grace_murray_hopper.jpg">Grace Hopper</a>
did her early work on this kind of computer.

<p>It was Ms. Hopper who invented the term "bug" to mean a problem in a
computer.  One day the computer she was using had a problem.  They
traced it down to one relay that wasn't working right.  They found a
moth whose wings had gotten stuck between the two pieces of metal,
keeping them apart.  Thus, the relay wouldn't complete the circuit
when it was supposed to, and the computer didn't work right.  We still
call computer problems "bugs", and programmers are always talking
about "stomping bugs" and being "bitten by bugs".

<p>These relay-based computers represented the <em>first generation</em> of
computers.  However, they were very slow - relays can only turn on and
off a few hundred times a second.  Also they were unreliable - relays
were always getting dirty and breaking down.  A new kind of switch was
needed.

<p>In the 1940s, they started making computers out of vacuum tubes.  I
doubt that any of you have ever
<a href="http://www.digitalcentury.com/encyclo/update/vt-photo.html">seen a vacuum tube</a>
- they used to be
inside of radios and T.V.s.  They did basically the same thing as
relays, except they didn't have any moving parts.  No little pieces of
metal to break or get dirty.  And they worked much faster than a relay
- a vacuum tube can turn on and off thousands of times a second.
Computers were made with thousands of vacuum tubes.  With these <em>second
generation</em> computers, programs could be more sophisticated, and
computers could do many more things.

<p>But even vacuum tubes were unreliable.  Each tube contained a heating
element which could burn out (like a light bulb burns out).  Also,
sometimes they developed leaks and air got inside them, which
prevented them from working right.  A large computer would typically
only work for a few weeks before a bunch of tubes had to be replaced.

<p>In the late 1950s, a new kind of switch was used in computers, called the
<a href="http://www.digitalcentury.com/encyclo/update/tr-photo.html">transistor</a>.
A transistor required no heating element and no vacuum.
They were also much smaller than tubes, and required much less power.
They also switched faster - instead of switching on and off a few
thousand times a second like vacuum tubes, they could go a few hundred
thousand times a second.  These <em>third generation</em> computers were the
first to really became a huge commercial success.  Instead of
thousands of tubes, computers were made of tens of thousands, or even
hundreds of thousands of transistors.  But remember that one
transistor is basically just a switch, just like a vacuums tube or a
relay.  Just smaller, cheaper, and more reliable.

<p>In the early 60s, engineers figured out how to pack many
transistors into one component, called an integrated circuit ("i.c."
for short, or "chip").  The first i.c.s contained just a handful of
transistors, but it didn't take long for the transistor count in an
i.c. to grow.  Modern day memory chips can have more than 8 million
transistors on a square chip less than a quarter inch on a side.  When
i.c.-based computers first were made, the central processing unit
(CPU) used to be as large as a refrigerator; now the whole thing is on
a chip less than an inch on a side.  Instead of hundreds of thousands
of individual transistors, modern computers contain billions of them,
on hundreds of i.c.s.  Since the transistors are smaller and closer
together, they can also turn on and off faster - tens of millions
times a second.  For example, if you see a computer rated at 75
megahertz (MHz), that means that the switches inside can turn on and
off 75 million times in a second.  These <em>fourth generation</em> computers
are still basically the same as their ancestors, but are much smaller,
cheaper, more reliable, and use less power.  But it all boils down to
a simple switch.

<p>What's next?  What will the <em>fifth generation</em> be like?  Nobody knows
for sure.  The past thirty years have been spent making i.c.s with
more and more transistors.  There is still a little ways to go before
we exhaust i.c. technology.  But eventually we will - we will reach a
point where we can't fit any more transistors on one chip.  At that
point, a new kind of switch will be needed.  Maybe it will use lasers,
or maybe super conductors.  Maybe one of you will invent a totally new
kind of switch that will make today's i.c.s look like clunky old
relays.
