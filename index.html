<p>I don't do much with my web site any more.  See my
<a href="http://blog.geeky-boy.com/">blog</a> for more.

<h2>My Content</h2>
<ul>

<li><a href="standard.html"><b>Standard Disclaimer</b></a>
- If I've fooled you into thinking that I know what I'm talking about, you
had better read my standard disclaimer.

<br><br>
<li><a href="astronomy/html/"><b>Astronomy</b></a>
- I like to star-gaze.  Among other things, I wrote a parent's guide to
buying a child a telescope.

<br><br>
<li>Iguana Blurb
- I like Giant Green Iguanas (that's what the cute little green iguanas
become).  I wrote a beginner's guide to keeping a pet iguana, but it is so old that I took it down.

<br><br>
<li><a href="b89.html"><b>The Continuing Adventures of Borris, the Amazing Talking Dog</b></a>
- My sense of humor is a little ... um ... unusual.

<br><br>
<li><a href="http://blog.geeky-boy.com/"><b>Blog</b></a>
- My personal blog.

<br><br>
<li><a href="w/index.html"><b>Wiki dump</b></a>
- A dump of my now-defunct personal wiki.  Not sure there is much in there of interest to a general audience.

<br><br>
<li><b>Other social media</b></a>
- Please don't use <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fordsfords">my FaceBook page</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/fordsfords">my Twitter feed</a>.
I generally accept friend requests on FaceBook from people I know, but I never post anything and I never log in an read other people's postings.
Ditto with Twitter.
In spite of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184658/Is-joining-Facebook-sign-youre-psychopath-Some-employers-psychologists-say-suspicious.html">the risks</a>, I just don't have time.

<br><br>
<li>bbs_thingie - a now-defunct message board that I used to host.

</ul>
<h2>My Software</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fordsfords/q/tree/gh-pages"><b>q module</b></a> (queue)
- software package (in C) which implements a fast, lock-free, non-blocking queue.

<br><br>
<li><a href="bbst"><b>BBST</b></a> (BBS Thingie)
- software package (in Perl) which implements "bbs_thingie" message board.

<br><br>
<li><a href="semlit/html/"><b>SEMLIT</b></a> (Semi-Literate documentation)
- software package to produce detailed source code documentation.

</ul>

<h2>My Email</h2>

<p>I don't like email very much, and I've got a pretty full life these days.  The astronomy and
iguana pages are very old and out of date, and I have no particular desire to update them.  If you
have a quick and easy question, there's a good chance I'll respond within a week or two, but don't
get your hopes up too high.

<p>If, after reading that, you still want to email me, <b>my email domain is geeky-boy.com and my
email account on that domain is sford</b>.  I wrote it out that way so that email address harvesters
wouldn't find it.  (Not that it helps much - I get plenty of spam as it is.)
