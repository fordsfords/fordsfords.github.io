Wisconsin Dells

<hr>

<p>OK, I'll admit it - I like kid stuff.  Trampolines, playgrounds, and
the ultimate kid entertainment, the water park.  The longer the water
slide, the better.  And for the <em>true</em> water park enthusiast, where
else can you go other than
Noah's Ark
in beautiful Wisconsin Dells?
(See
<a href="http://www.dells.com">http://www.dells.com</a>
and
<a href="http://www.wisdells.com">http://www.wisdells.com</a>
for official Dells tourist info.)

<p>We usually
<a href="wimp-camping.html">wimp camp</a>
in Holiday Shores and spend our days at Noah's.
We've also "done the Ducks" and taken a scenic boat tour.  And we've
even tried out some of the other water parks there.  (Although we've never
been to the Foam House.)  But we always go back to Noah's.

<p>But in all the Dells, the place that <em>DEMANDS</em> your attention the most is the
<a href="http://www.tommybartlett.com/">Tommy Bartlet</a>
thrill show.
As you approach the Dells, even before you enter Wisconsin, you start
seeing signs for Tommy Bartlet.  The closer you get, the more signs
you see.  There are <em>thousands</em> of them scattered all over the
Wisconsin countryside.  There are also signs for other Dells
attractions, but I'de be willing to bet that Tommy outnumbers all the
others combined.

<p>We've been to Tommy's and I guess it was worth the time spent (if not
the money paid).  It wasn't bad.  But was it worth all the hype?  Let's
just say that Mr. Bartlett's motto must be, "If P. T. Barnum can put
on the greatest show on earth and hype it, I can at least match the
hype part of it."
