Wimp Camping
</h1>

<hr>

<p>We all know what <em>real</em> camping is, right?  You wear your high-tech
boots, hike into uncharted
forest, and set up one of those high-tech tents that weighs a four ounces.
You eat high-tech freeze-dried food and drink water from a crystal
mountain stream (first run through a high-tech water filter, of course).
And if you wash yourself at all, you do it in that same crystal
mountain stream (temp: 35 F) and scrub down with sand.
And you construct a canoe from a tree using nothing but a pocket knife and
some dental floss.

<p>Wimp camping is kinda like that.  Except that you wear Nikes, drive
mini-van to a
Kampground (it's <em>very</em> important for it to be spelled with a "K"), and
rent one of those Kabins.  You cook food from your ice-chest
over a propane stove and drink Diet Coke.
And you take a hot shower every morning in the bath house.  And you
rent a motor boat from the Kampground office.

<p>Hey, you just gotta get back to nature sometimes.
