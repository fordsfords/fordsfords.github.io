<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>1. a. - Sketch the face of the moon, indicating on it the locations of at least five seas (mares) and five craters.</h3>

<ul>
<p>There is a long history of astronomers (both amature and professional)
making sketches of what they see.  The great astronomers from years ago became
great illustrators as well.  Even today, astronomers make drawings of what
they see through the telescope.  It helps to train the eye and the mind to
pick out details.

<p>The best way to complete this requirement is to make the sketch at
a telescope.  Use a low-power eyepeice so that you can see the whole disk
of the moon.  Sketch what you see, including as much detail as you can.
Then use a lunar map to help you identify and label the mares and craters.

<p>Here is a labeled lunar map:

</ul>

<h3>1. b. - Within a single week, sketch the position of the moon in the sky at thesame hour on three different evenings.  Explain the changes observed.</h3>

<ul>
<p>No need for a telescope here.  Because of the frequency of cloudy evenings,
you should check *every* night.  When you make your sketch, don't bother
including detail of the moon's surface.  But do draw the approximate shape
of the moon, and <em>include several nearby bright stars</em>.  Try to make
your drawing accurate and to scale.  Make the star dots fatter for bright
stars.  <em>Be sure to record the your name, date, time (dst?), location
(city/state),
and direction you're facing (compass bearing) on each drawing!</em>  Make
this standard for every astronomical sketch you make.
</ul>

<h3>1. c. - Tell what factors keep the moon in orbit around the Earth.</h3>

<ul>
<p>Uh ... true love?  A big rubber band?
</ul>

<h3>2. a. - Photograph or locate on a map of the sky a planet at approximately weekly intervals at the same time of the night for at least four weeks.  Explain any changes.</h3>

<ul>
<p>Sky photography can be very fun and rewarding, but can also be difficult.
I've never tried it.  If you do 3. a., you will fulfill this requirement.
</ul>

<h3>2. b. - I recommend doing 3. a. (which satisfies 2. a.)</h3>

<ul>
<p>I assume you don't actually want to spend a whole year doing this.  I
don't recommend doing this one - do 3. a. instead.
</ul>

<h3>3. a. - In a sketch show the position of Venus, Mars, or Jupiter in the sky at approximately the same time for at least four weeks.</h3>

<ul>
<p>As with the Moon sketch, include several nearby bright stars.  Be careful
to make the drawing accurate to scale.
</ul>

<h3>3. b. and c. - I recommend doing 3. a.</h3>

<ul>
<p>As with the Moon sketch, include several nearby bright stars.  Be careful
to make the drawing accurate to scale.
</ul>

<h3>4. - Using the shadow of a vertical pole in sunshine, lay out a true north-south line (a meridian).  Then, using a line and the pole on another day, measure the altitude of the noontime sun and determine your latitude.</h3>

<ul>
<p>This requires some Trig to do correctly, and depends a great deal on the
time of year.  Fortunately, it is close to the fall Equinox, so it should be
quite a bit easier.  We should be able to approximate it.  (We'll need a
protractor.)
</ul>

<h3>5. - Identify at least 10 constellations, four of which are in the zodiac.  Identify at least eight conspicuous stars, five of which are of the first magnitude.</h3>

<ul>
<p>We'll use a planesphere to do this.
</ul>

<h3>5. a. - Show in a sketch the position of the Big Dipper and its relation to the North Star and the horizon early some evening and again six hours later the same night.  Record the date and time of making each sketch.</h3>

<ul>
<p>If you were to do this same activity six months later, how would it look?
</ul>

<h3>5. b. - Explain what we see when we look at the Milky Way.</h3>

<ul>
<p>Please let it be clear!  You can't see the Milky Way from a city (Chicago
or Milwaukee).  Gotta get out in the country where the sky appears BLACK.
Best to do it when the moon is not up (don't do it on a full Moon).
</ul>

<h3>6. - With the aid of diagrams (or real telescopes if available) explain the difference between reflecting and refracting telescopes.  Describe the basic purpose of a telescope and list at least three other instruments used with telescopes.</h3>

<ul>
<p>Use my "Parents Guide" to learn this:
<a href="http://www.geeky-boy.com/astro/kid_scope.html">http://www.geeky-boy.com/astro/kid_scope.html</a>
</ul>

<h3>7. a. - Describe the composition of the Sun, its relationship to other stars, and some effects of its radiation on the Earth's weather.  Define sunspots and describe some of the effects they may have on this radiation.</h3>

<ul>
<p>Looks like you've got some research to do.  You can e-mail your report to me.
</ul>

<h3>7. b. - Identify at least one star that is red, one that is blue, and one that is yellow, and explain the meaning of these colors.</h3>

<ul>
<p>Most people think stars are white.  Period.  But if you really look, you
can see different hues.  Finding a yellow star will be VERY easy.  ;-)

<h1>Supplimental Material</h1>

<p>I have an astronomy web page at
<a href="http://www.geeky-boy.com/astro/">http://www.geeky-boy.com/astro/</a>
which has a lot of science information.  It also has a guide for parents
who want to buy a telescope for their children:
<a href="http://www.geeky-boy.com/astro/kid_scope.html">http://www.geeky-boy.com/astro/kid_scope.html</a>
Feel free to look at it and pass it on to your folks if you're interested.

<h2>From Ashes Comes Life</h2>

<p>You know that all things, including living things, are made of atoms.
Lop off a finger and divide it up by atoms and you'll find a lot of hydrogen,
oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen.  You'll also find a fair amount of other kinds
of atoms - iron in our blood, phosphorous in our protien and DNA, even
traces of heavier metals like chromium, copper, and zinc.

<p>But where did these atoms come from?  Shortly after the Big Bang when
atoms first formed, you had mostly Hydrogen, a fair amount of Helium, and
some Lithium, but not much else.  Vast hydrogen clouds condensed into stars.
The energy source of stars is nuclear fusion, which consists of taking light
atoms and crushing them together so tightly that they form heavier atoms.
For example, when two Hydrogen atoms are squeezed tightly enough, they combine
into one atom of Helium, and in the process release energy.

<p>As a star ages, it has less Hydrogen to fuse, and eventually it starts
fusing Helium atoms together in fairly complex reactions that produce Oxygen
and Carbon.  This reaction releases some (but not as much) energy, and the
star keeps shining.  Eventually, the star dies (stops producing energy) in
one of two ways - either it expells its outer layers into a so-called
"planetary nebula" (a poor name since it has <em>nothing</em> to do with
planets), or it violently exploads as a super nova.  In both cases, large
amounds of the heavy elements that were manufactured inside the star during
its life are flung into space.

<p>And *that* is what planets and everything on them, including ourselves,
are made of - the remains of dead stars.  Life as we know it was
not possible in our universe until enough stars had been formed, shined
for millions of years, and then died.
