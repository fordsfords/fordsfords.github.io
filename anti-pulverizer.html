Anti-Pulverizer?
<p>
Margaret took a closer look at the plastic bottle.
<p>

  mance and fragrance appeal of more expensive brands for less:

<p>
Ha!  It was actually written like that.  Instead of anti-perspirant, it
said Anti-Pulverizer.
<p>
Margaret smiled and and put the bottle of shampoo back on the
shelf, making a mental note to tell Steve about the misprint.
He would like that one.
<p>
She continued down the aisle of the Health and Beauty section to
the lip balm display.  She couldn't find her normal brand, but she
was drawn to a tube that showed a pair of icy lips.  The label said
"No Burn".  The fine print said that it was safe and effective
against the effects of wind, sun, and spontanious combustion.
<p>
Marketers were getting stranger and stranger.
<p>
She checked her list.  The last item was bug spray for an ant
problem she had recently discovered in her house.  She craned her
neck and found the aisle labeled "Pest Control".  When she reached
it, she stopped short.
<p>
The entire aisle, both sides, was pest control.
<p>
Shelf after shelf of gaily-colored boxes and cans, showing a variety
of fantastic creatures.  The Woverine Repellent showed something that
couldn't possibly be an accurate drawing of a woverine, although
she couldn't think off-hand what a woverine actually looked like
(she imagined a small, shaggy dog-like creature). This one had a
mouth that was open much too wide and its teeth were far too long
and numerous.  Any creature that looked like that couldn't even
close its mouth.
<p>
There was a can of bee killer that had what looked like a radar
dish on top.
A propane tank had a picture of somebody attacking
a garden slug with a flame thrower.
A long
stick-like device with a telescopic sight
claimed to be able to take down a robin from
a hundred feet.  Robins weren't even pests!
<p>
Feeling like she was in the wrong part of town, Margaret decided
to forgo the ant spray and hustle to the checkout line.  This would
teach her to stop at an unfamilliar store.
<p>
The checkout clerk was pleasent and efficient, scanning the items.
She paused at the lip balm, smiled, and said, "This has saved *my*
life more than once."  Margaret smiled back, paid with a credit card,
and hustled out the door with her bag.
<p>
And stopped dead.
<p>
The sky was brillient green.  Two suns stared back at her,
one small and blinding white near the horizon, the other bloated and
bright red straight up.  The parking lot was
filled with vehicles that looked like strange mutated crosses between cars
and tanks, complete with gun turrets on top.
<p>
Suddenly, a shrieking roar, a blinding flash, and a huge rock streaked
from the sky, smashing one of the tank/cars and sending shards of burning
wreckage skittering across the parking lot.  The stentch of sulfer hung
thick in the air.
<p>
Margaret stared at the burning car/tank a moment longer, then turned
and re-entered the store.  Suave anti-pulverizer might not be such
a bad idea after all.
