<h1>Introduction to Crunch</h1>
</center>

<p>This story is written in 1998 by, for, and about computer geeks (or
geek-wannabes).  It represents a fairly near-term future, perhaps
20 years from now.  Maybe less.  Although techno-geeks are my primary
audience, I hope I've written a story that can appeal to the general
science fiction reader.

<p>The story was written on an interactive message board ("bbs").  I
posted the story in fragments and the other participants would often times
post responses.  As the author, I can tell you that having some interaction
with the reader made the process of writing the story far more enjoyable.

<p>For the web-based version of the story, I cleaned a few things up and
removed some of the chatter.  But I also left some of the comments in.
