<h1>BOB 4.X Series End-Of-Life Announced</h1>

<p>September 13, 2007

<p><b>Warrenville, IL (AP)</b> -- 29West announced today that with
the introduction of BOB 5.0, it would
be dropping support for BOB 4.9, effective immediately. "We've had
strong demand for BOB 4.9, both domestically and internationally," said
29West CEO Mark Mahowald at a hastily-convened press conference. "But
the 4.X series has been showing its age for several releases now, and we
felt it was time for customers to enjoy the benefits of a new major
release number."

<p>Reaction among uers was mixed. Marg N Oferror, CEO of Murky Research,
waxed rhapsodic at BOB 5.0's release. "We couldn't be more
delighted! Our support contract entitles us to a substantial discount
on the upgrade, and believe me, a higher major release number is worth
every penny!"

<p>Others are taking more of a wait-and-see attitude. Sedona Tush,
receptionist at Dirty Running Wear (slogan: "No Stain, No Gain"), was only mildly
impressed with BOB 4.9. "I've seen a lot of BOB-like packages come and
go. The good ones take me golfing and give me meals. Good meals, like
all-you-can-eat good, and that's pretty darn good, especially when you
can stuff rolls and packets of jelly into your pockets. Will BOB 5.0 do
that? HUH?"

<p>When asked if 29West would be replacing the entire BOB line with a newer
design, Mark was philosophical. "A lot of people like BOB. We're quite
fond of BOB ourselves, the same way one might like an pair of ratty
sneakers or a smelly old sweatshirt. BOB 5.0 uniquely fills a unique
niche in our product line, and we look forward to milking the market
even further with BOB 5.1, due out sometime next year."
