Joey

<hr>

<p>A CD player programmed for auto-repeat started its 71st rendition of
"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" to an almost empty room.  Besides a
$150 stereo system, the apartment contained a bare mattress (found a
few weeks earlier by a dumpster), an ice chest (ice courtesy of the Ramada
inn, down the street), and Joey.

<p>Joey sat on the floor, head lolling to the side, a small puddle of
saliva slowly drying on the floor beside him.  He stared at the
puddle; he supposed that the saliva was his, but how could one ever be
sure?  The tiny bubbles in the spit had remarkable staying power; when
he first regained conscienceness, he counted 38 of them.  Now, 17
plays of Lucy later, there were still 23.  Oops, make that 22.  A wisp
of red and yellow drifted up from the site of the burst bubble.  Joey
tried to inhale it as it drifted by, but the wisp ignored him and
joined the 24 other wisps that circled the ceiling.  Hmm ... how many
bubbles had burst before he woke up?  38, 23, 24, 17; his mind tried
to figure it, but the numbers kept melting into little bubbling pools
of their own.  He couldn't get them to stay up straight long enough to
carry the one.

<p>As Lucy number 71 closed, so did Joey's eyes.

<p>When Joey's eyes opened again, he couldn't see the saliva any more.
He puzzled over this for several minutes before realizing that he
couldn't see much of anything.  The light was gone.

<p>And something else was missing too...  what could it be?  The colored
wisps were gone from the ceiling, but they always evaporated in a few
hours.  He could still hear traffic noise outside.  He actually
smelled something new ... a sweet, warm smell, the same smell he found
in the stair-wells of his apartment building.  He looked in his lap to
see if it was his, but it was too dark.  What was missing?

<p>Lucy.

<p>He glanced up at his stereo and noticed that it no longer emitted cool
light from it's dials.  The digital clock no longer flashed 12:00.
The landlord must have discovered Joey's master switch bypass in the
basement.  Eviction papers were sure to be next.  Joey had better
think about scratching up enough money to pay a deposit on a new
apartment.

<p>Lucy was gone.

<p>Why did everything have to be so hard?  Joey didn't ask for much.  His
needs were few.  He had lived his whole life without anybody taking
much notice of him.  His mother had left him with an aunt when he was
three.  When Mom didn't come back the next day like she promised, the
aunt was a lot more upset than Joey was.  A few weeks later he was at
another aunt's apartment.  Here, at least, there was more to eat
(although you had to be quick to catch it).  But the apartment was so
crowded that Joey couldn't get a moment's peace.  Joey needed peace.
It was the only way he could find his way home.  The constant fighting
in the apartment drove Joey to the stair wells.  There he could find
enough peace to get home for several hours a day.

<p>And Lucy was always there, waiting for him.

<p>Those early years of Joey's were just another form of auto-repeat.
New faces, new apartments, sometimes blue uniforms, sometimes white
uniforms; none of it really mattered.  It was all basically the same,
just background noise, something to be endured between his journies
home.  Between his journies back to Lucy.  Life alternated between the
meaningless chaos of the in-between time, and being home with Lucy.

<p>But now, Lucy was gone.

<p>One day, when he was about 16, he went home and flung open the door
and cried "Lucy, I'm here!"  But something was missing.  He wasn't
greeted by the familiar "I'm in here" issuing faintly from one of
the rooms in the big old house.  Was Lucy playing a game with him?
Hide-and-seek?  Joey ran from room to room, shouting "Ah HAH!" each
time he flung open a door.  But Lucy wasn't there.

<p>Joey was disappointed, but he wasn't to worried.  In the chaotic
in-between times, people appeared and disappeared like fireflies.
They had important things to do.  Lucy was probably running some
important errand.  Delivering a package, or something.  She was
probably taking an envelope from a tall man on a street corner and
slipping it under a certain door of a certain apartment building.
Happens all the time.

<p>But Lucy didn't come back.

<p>He never again felt her thick strong arms encircling him, never
smelled hot apple pie coming from the kitchen, never again lay on the
wide lap that could hold all of him at once as she stroked his hair
and hummed an aimless tune.

<p>Years past.  The old house started showing its age.  The roof leaked,
crawly things infested the kitchen the smell of mold permeated
everything.  Strange people started living there, not people like
Lucy, but the same kind of people who surrounded Joey during the
in-between times.  One day, they wouldn't let him in any more, and he
had to sit outside in the cold.  These days, he had trouble telling
the difference between being home and being in the between times.

<p>Joey stood up in the dark.  He walked across the room and picked up
his stereo, wrapping is cord around it.

<p>Time to find a new apartment.
