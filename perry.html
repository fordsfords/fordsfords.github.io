<h2><a name=Lbl1>
Forward</a></h2>

<p>My daughter has a pet lizard, an iguana that she calls Perry.
Several months ago, I discovered that Perry can communicate. Through
a series of dreams, I learned how to interpret his eye and tail
movements. Unfortunately, Perry hasn't had similar dreams about me
and so the communication is pretty much one-way. This story is
actually Perry's own story, told in approximately his own "words".

<p>I have taken some liberty with grammar and sentence structure to
make the reading easier. For example, the three movements
representing "water", "not", and "food" would be translated as "My
food is dry." A sentence like this might be followed by a tail whip,
representing anger or alarm. In that case, I would write "Damn, my
food is dry."

<p>One thing that I still haven't figured out yet is whom he is talking
to. I would like to get another iguana and put them together to see
if they would talk to each other. My suspicion is that they
wouldn't. I believe that his "talking" is more like a person who
moves his lips when he reads. It is more of a physical manifestation
of his thought process. It's not intended to communicate at all.

Observation 1, Elapsed time: 20 minutes</a></h2>

<p>Damn, there's the big monster again [he's refering to me]. I don't
see why it doesn't just eat me and get it over with. There are no
decent hiding places here. There's the fake plant, but any fool
could see me under there. The glass walls ["barrier"+"not"] prevent
me from getting to all the really good hiding places near here.
Hopefully, it will just leave me alone. I'll play dead and it will
forget about me.

<p>[several minutes pass]

<p>I'm cold. Time for a bask. Damn fake plant; what good is it? Can't
eat it, can't really hide under it. I'll get on the log for a nice
bask.

<p>[several minutes pass]

<p>The sun never moves. It feels wrong. When the monster moves it, it
looses it's warmth [note: Perry seems to recognize the difference
between me moving his light and the natural movement that the sun
would have]. Even when it's warm, it's wrong. I want a new sun.
Damn.

<p>I check the food. Damn, it's dry. The monster might bring me more.
Damn! I hate being dependant on it ["hate" + "like" + "need" +
"monster" + "damn"]. Something's wrong. The plants should be all
around. They should always be moist. The sun is wrong. The plants
are wrong. The glass walls are wrong. The monster should just eat
me. I'll eat him. Damn.

<p>[I reach in to get him]

<p>Damn! Damn! I'll run! Glass wall! I'll eat him! Ah, the monster
retreats! I'll eat him!

<p>[after dodging a bite attempt, I grab him. I let him stand on my
outstreached hand and he bites me three times. Since he is so small,
it's completely painless].

<p>I can't eat the monster. It will eat me. I'll play dead. I'll close
my eyes. It's touching me. I'm dead.

<p>[As I pet him, he closes his eyes. This calms him. Unseen danger
bothers him much less than seen danger (unlike humans). After a few
moments, he opens his eyes.]

<p>Maybe it will drop me. I see a multitude of hiding places. I'm
pretty high up; I better not jump.

<p>[At this point, I put some diced carrots on my hand.]

<p>Food! Good, it's moist. It gives me more; I'll eat my fill. Ah. Ah.
Ah.

<p>Full now. Why does the monster do this? It's a fool. Maybe it
doesn't eat. How can something alive not eat? [This statement
suprised me; he understands more about the world than I ever
imagined] Maybe it eats other monsters. Why does it hold me? Maybe
I'm bait for other monsters. It gives me food so I will be alive.
Other monsters come for me and this monster eats them. Yes. But what
if other monsters come while this monster is gone? I hope not. I'm
tired. I'll nap now.

<p>[I put Perry on his log; he wakes up briefly as I move him but goes
back to sleep]

<h2><a name=Lbl3>
Observation 2, Elapsed time: 15 minutes</a></h2>

<p>The monster is here again. Will it eat me?

<p>[Becky comes into sight]

<p>Damn! Now there's a multitude of monsters. [Iguanas can't count past
one. Any reference to plural is translated as "multitude"] I don't
like the little one. [a fact that makes Becky upset] I'll play dead.
They will go away.

<p>[I pick up Perry and put him on Becky's bed]

<p>Damn! Freedom! But the monsters are all around me. Maybe I can get
away over here. Damn, they keep moving to block me. I'm going to get
eaten now. I can tell. They keep making these noises. They're
probably finishing off a monster they've just eaten. I'm next. I'll
play dead. That seems to work.

<p>Now the big one is picking me up. Who's going to bite me first? Now
it's putting me back on my log. What is going on? Don't they ever
eat?

<p>Damn, my food's dry.
